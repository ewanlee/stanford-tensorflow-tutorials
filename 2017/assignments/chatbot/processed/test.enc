There.
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
No.
Queen Harry?
You are so completely unbalanced.
Like you care.
He was, like, a total babe
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
I just wanted --
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
Patrick -- is that- a.
Wear the belly before you go.
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
So -- which Dakota you from?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
You burn, you pine, you perish?
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
He seems like he thrives on danger
It's a lung cancer issue
You told me that part already.
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
Sure
Yeah
You just said
Do what?
Hey.
Nope - just came by to chat
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
You hate me don't you?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
You're not okay.
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Why 're you doing this?
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Why'd you let him get to you?
And I'm in control of it.
Busy
BIANCA
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
I hate peas.
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
Because you're making decisions for me.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
Sweet love, renew thy force!
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
I could be gone for years.
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
Appointment to what?
I have to explore the mainland.
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
All I have to do is call the guards.
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
How did you manage it?
How can you be so certain?
Father Marchena!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
New worlds create new people.
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
What do you read?
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
Don't say anything.
You bring the cigarettes?
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
Divorced.
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
What was that, Korfin?
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
Sorry...PD only.
What's wrong?
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
Nah, why should you?
Did you get a report from the M.E.?
Mind if I ride along with you?
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
I'm serious here.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
There are two bodies found at this point.
Eddie, are you okay?
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Alright.
Alright.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
You promise?
Yeah.  I promise.
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
Where's Czech girl?
I have five-hundred dollars.
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
Turn that fucking thing off!
You said speak Czech!
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
I'm serious.
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
Yes, the money is good.
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
Well, he...
Yes...he's my friend.
I'm here for movies.
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
No.  Go ahead.
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
What??
What?
Get outta here!
Your doctor?
Yes?
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
Oh?
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
I guess not.
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
CONTINUED
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
Oh, thank you very much.
Thank you.
And your charming little daughter?
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
I understand.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Now how's your memory doin'?
I want to drive awhile.
Pay money?
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
Where's ganz?
You got a name, cop?
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
What do you think?
Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
There.
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
Just tell me about the money.
We split 50-50?
Right, partner.
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
You stay with me...
We missed.
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Yeah?
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
So do you...been a long day.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
A cop...
I don't think your gun's loaded...
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
What'd you do?
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
No wonder you're so popular.
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
So what?
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
Stall.
Keep stallin'.
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
Don't give me this, we were partners.
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
Come on, you can trust me. Please.
How you doing, man?
How about some ammo?
Corn-i-Lius?
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
...We're saved!
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!
I brought the girl remember?
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
Good luck..
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
So, just how big was this fare?
...Priest...
When EVIL returns so shall we.
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
...Shit!
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
Cornelius..
Learning language.
Which one?
Uh...
You know women normally change five times more than men.
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
Exactly.
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
I want your best man on this!
Staedert, do you read me?
Perfect, Mr. President.
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Got it.
How's our deal coming along?
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.
You couldn't?
You're killing me...
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
... sorry...
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
You got absolute zero.
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
You're making me very angry.
Big date tonight?
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
Remember me?
How long you been working there?
Max.
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
What about me?
A daughter.
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
It's their Presidential Suite.
Who is he, his name?
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
No.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
It won't work like that.
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
Okay.
You told me to look, so I looked.
I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
She just seemed... depressed... ?
Are you religious?
What?
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.
Hey, Rick!
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
Yeah...I guess.
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
Sobering...
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
What's that got to do with it?
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.
I thought about that.
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
Who?
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
You, too?
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
I guess.
'Us?'
Wonderful!
Anything ---
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?
What do you think?
But - what can we accomplish?
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
He did!
Well, I'll be - !
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
You don't believe me?
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
How soon?
This spring.
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
Guaranteed, eh?
They said.
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
Open the door, will ya?
I just think you used to be bad.
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
It's fun.
I called Mommy.
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
It's pretty old.
Pop?
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
I'm not saying that.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
Huh?
You mean Twombley?
He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.
How you holding up, Wade?
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
So?
Maybe.
The key, Wade.
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
You knew me as a kid.
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
You've been married twice --
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
How?
This is nuts.
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
When did she die?
Can --?
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
Yes. Here's your ticket.
Something about my father?
What?
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
Jack?
What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
You think Jack shot him?
Well, it was an accident.
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
Then who shot him?
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
I don't know. You tell me.
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
I'm sure he's busy.
Oooooh, I'm good.
How was...  ...the ballet?
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
Nine.
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
*                     Please tell me your name.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.
I know he left you behind.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
Finally, we can bargain.
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
What?
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
Someone should give you a raise.
But...
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
Shut down accelerators.
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
Elaine, what happened to us?
Ted.
We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!
Now!
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
Scraps.
Can I hold him?
No.  Poached.  Over.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
You got a telegram from head­quarters today.
Yes?
See them, Elaine?
You promise you'll write.
How ya doing, honey?
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
I like my horizons narrow.
Lay off, asshole.
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
What is this?
Get the picture?
So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
You know that guy?
This is mole.  It's good.
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
Well, let's roll, George.
To the... to the beach?
Stop the car.
What was that about?
What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.
No!  We must do this alone.
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.
How do I look?
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
Hope their plumbing's the same.
What?
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
How long until it blows?
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
Now, wait a second --
What is it?
I don't know.
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
What's the question?
Alive?
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
Now many?
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
Nine meters.  Eight.
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
How long have I been on Gateway station?
Cross my heart.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
Yes, there are, aren't there.
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
Newt.  Newt, wake up.
Wah...?  Where are...?
Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.
Why?
Did you know? Had you heard?
How was I? Tell me honestly.
You were sublime.
No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
Hardly.
No! No! No!
That's stupid.
Do you think that's funny?
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
Oh yes? You always know everything.
Yes!
Well, ask her!
What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?
Give me one reason I can understand.
Frau Mozart?
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
These are originals?
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
He's doing his best.
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
Behold!
And the result satisfies.
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
Yes?
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
Majesty!
Yes, indeed.
And German?
What do you mean, Sire?
My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Ah, love again.
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
What's that?
Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
Papa, is this your idea?
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
That's right.
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
Madame.
They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
What exactly are you working on?
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
But what is it they don't like?
How could it not, Excellency?
What dead? Who is dead?
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
The doctor thinks I am. But -
Where did I stop?
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
Do you believe in it?
What?
We ended in F Major?
Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?
And that's all?
And that's it. Do you have it?
Exactly.
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
Herr Mozart -
In the sight of God that is a sin.
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
Here in Vienna.
Is it true?
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
I poisoned his life.
He's setting that play to music?
Are you absolutely sure?
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
I agree, Baron.
But he's all right?
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
Oh, Miss Price?
What exactly did he call out?
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
What did he say?
Warn him?
What shall we do?
Yes?
You haven't eaten your lunch.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
Call me Alex.
Now what do you want to talk about?
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
What?
Now I'm embarrassed.
Your dead friend Jack?
The bedroom.
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...
Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!
No.
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
Feeling better?
There's no call for that kind of language.
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
Alex?
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
I really don't know.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
I assume full responsibility.
Ask them what the candles are for.
Right.
Yeah?
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
Jack?
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
You were saying?
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...
Remember the Alamo?
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
I don't rightly know, sir.
Hello, Tom.
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
Whose death?
And tell him not to delay.
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?
Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
We've been waiting fifteen minutes—
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
Thanks.
Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer—
My apartment.
I'm not interested in what you think.
I'm feeling fine this morning.
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Ho! Ho! Ho!
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Mr. Sampson . . .
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
Of course it's true - and he knows it.
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
I'm afraid so.
Hello, Helen!
Why?
Well . . . ?
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
Mr. Williams . . .
Did you say Dude Finlay?
—for the rheumatism, you know.
What time did Matt Brown get in?
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
Then who changed it?
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
How?
What have you done?
Yesterday.
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...
How many of them did he kill?
The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here...
Not now.
What is wrong with you?
She had a moustache.
Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
Yep.
Beautiful.
Bob, rip up some bandages.
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
Well?
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
What is it?
So?
Daddy, don't start with this again.
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
I figure.
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
You taking sides against me, now, Frank?
Jim was old enough...
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
Doc Mimms will --
Jesse, are you awake?
What?
I don't understand.
Don't turn around.
You are a hell of a woman.
Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.
Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.
Thanks.
Right here in church?
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
I guess so.
I think so.
... too young for whisky...
Why, yeah.
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
Really?
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
How can that be?
And it is my pleasure to be here.
I want them arrested and hanged!
"The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!"  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!
Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
Can't you tell me anything?
Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
You like it there, don't you?
Eight?
Pull out.
Pull out, goddamnit!
It's a plain end. I think.
It's a plain end, see? So?
Why?
Nothing like last time, promise.
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
I'm just leaving.
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
Where are you going?
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
Late?
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
I'll do it.
Who?
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
Who's Ted Bundy?
What...No! Put it in the carton.
Jean-I'm not-
What?
Don't tell him you're here.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
So, what's the topic of discussion?
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
Nice. Very nice.
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
Let's see...  That you were with-
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
I'm so hungry.
Gee, uh, that's too bad.
I'm hungry
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
Yes, Owen?
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
No way. You have this -- destiny.
To our new life.  ...What's wrong?
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
Isn't that -- extreme?
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
You think I don't know that?
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.
...Why?
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
Great!
No.
That'll be a test, won't it?
You're living here?
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
...Hello?
'Think I should buy some originals?
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
You did this -- overnight?
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
You do?
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
You calling Phil and Randy?
...Were you?
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
Why's that?
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
Why were you snooping in my office?
I told Teddy about you.
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
That's lame, isn't it?
Does he know you know?
Maybe it's the satellite.
Latitude 47 degrees.
Jesus, Teddy.
What're they building?
What is it?
Who're these guys?
Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
What's the other thing you're scared of?
"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
Good on ya, man.
What's wrong with your hand?
I've got you, Dr. Evil!
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
I'm sorry?
My meat and two veg.
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
I haven't had fun like that since college.
Austin, may I have a word with you?
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?
All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
Are you crazy?
Danger Powers, personal effects.
Here, have a piece of gum.
Don't mind if I do.
Quite impressive.
What is it now?
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
In due time.
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
We don't label people here, Scott.
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
There are limits?
... bottle ...
... death ...
Flower ...
Would that I could say the Same.
I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --
Mr. John Steed, please.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Quite a collection.
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
Valentine, listen to me ...
Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
Doctor Peel, I presume?
Whereas you are.
I didn't. Mother did.
Steed, we really must be --
A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
June, July ... August?
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.
Is there anything that isn't?
Because you always obey orders ...
You're playing games.
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
Winning isn't everything.
You lied.
What's that you're wearing?
You first.
Our chaperon.
Surveillance? By whom?
The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.
Guilty until proven innocent?
Bang-bang ... you're dead.
Debbie's marrying Rick.
What do you mean?
I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes.
Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
Not interested.
Rick, I want to talk to you.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
The car for Debbie?
Nice shot.
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
Cole, I'm sorry, I...
God, you're a slob.
You're going to have a bachelor party?
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
It looks awful.
Are you going to have women at your party?
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
I can't sleep.
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
Yes...
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
Why is Cole here?
A real turd.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
What can I be doing for you?
I just want to be alone.
What the hell are you doing?
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
Feel free.
Rick!
The end.
Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
I don't know.
Very.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
Is he...
People actually used to pay you for this?
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
Ready?
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
You're back.
Thanks for calling.
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
Homey.
Then why did you quit?
You could check. It'd be in his files.
I'm sorry.
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
What?
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
Oh Jesus Christ...
Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...
What?
Your brother was a good man.
Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
Completely out of control.
Do you have to do that?
Stephen, what are you doing here?
Yeah? When was the last time?
He works for me.
-- Burn them.
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.
Who?
Yeah.
I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!
What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
I forgive you.
Large?
Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit. Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking lock. I wanna make some money.
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
This psycho can.
Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?
Keep trying.
Everybody say Ho!
Yeah!
If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
Delacroix.
I'm out.
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
Good morning, Cheeba.
How much?
Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
The name of the show?
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
What do you want?
Nuthin' I can't handle.
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
What is this?
The Jolly Nigger Bank.
Please don't go there.
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
Mommy, please don't call me that.
He wants you to come and see him.
He said that?
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
Where are you from?
Finland.
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
The one with da big...
...perfect...
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
I don't know who I am.
Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather.
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
You don't read, do you?
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
You can go now.
Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
What are the Chevalier's intentions?
A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
That's a very handsome sword you have there.
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
Is Miss Dugan well?
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?
I don't know.
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
Yes, of course.
Would you have me spend my life all alone?
Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
He loves me, as I love you.
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
Yeah, right...
You too?
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
And he'd been shot.
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
Why?
Right?
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
That's exactly what he says about you.
Why... why didn't you tell me?
But you didn't.
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
Something funny, Levi?
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
I'm sorry, Bill.
Stay where you are.
I'm not even going to dignify that --
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?
Excuse me?
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
Buttfucks the cabin?
That's a fantastic idea --
You couldn't have known --
No bodies, no West...
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
Pike and I got separated --
So you took off your shirt?
We just want --
Because he'd shot Mueller.
Pike never confessed.
Who, Levi --
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
You think he did it?
Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?
Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
What do you mean? You don't even know me.
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
Didn't kill anything, did I?
What is this place?
Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
Promise me you'll come back.
You must be Edward Bloom.
I never knew.
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
The one about the witch.
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
You owe me three-fifty.
There's a lot you don't know about me.
I will.
Why not religion, Dad?
But the real story is how I got the car. You see...
Son?
Dad!
What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.
It's unbelievable.
Really.
This is why you don't show work in progress.
'Fraid so.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
I'm going to get started on dishes.
Mmm.
We rented a car.
How is he?
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
So?
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
Yes.
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
Good. Or should I speak slower?
They go.
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
So you're just going to be vindictive
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
So now you hate all women?
Get out
She's alive!! She is not dead?
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
Okay. Thank you.
You have excellent English.
Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
Hey.
That young lady's size, right'cher.
Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company...
That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed.
You better pray, gal. You better pray...
Like a man.
How long... how long I been out?
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
In my house, you watch that lip...
LET ME GO!
Now you get up! And you get in my house!
My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that?
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
They sure liked them devilled eggs.
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
What'chu sayin'?
Nuh-uh.
You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it.
Then what?
Yes'sir.
I'm a what?
Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
Didn't know you was workin' here now?
You need money again?
But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
Mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, I'm tellin' you. I'm just lookin' ahead.  Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's Skittles. Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get you some cough medicine. What, you sick?
Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --
It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
Who do you think the Jap is?
Maybe we should do something?
... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
Hey, when in Rome --
This should be it...
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
What'd she say?
What does Charlie mean?
Where do we start looking for this guy?
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
Nick!
Give us a break...
You must leave?
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
What'd I tell you?
Nick!
A resort city, Beppu.
You did great, Ichiro.
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
Gaiijin?
Don't be an ass.
Can't make you change your mind?
Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives...
You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
What's this?
Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!
I have to get to Sugai.
If I say no?
You certainly have a nice place here.
Let's go while there is still time.
The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Why?
He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
Just thought I'd...
Then we're stupid and we'll die.
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
Industrial refuse.
Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.
Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia South.
Got it.
It's gotta be right for my customer.
Day after tomorrow.
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females.
But I would like to buy you drink.
Prosit.
Yeah?
What if you change your mind?
Yes?
Book the good ones for where?
What shows?
Yeah?
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
The best.
Are you apprehensive?
Me and my dad.
Where is he?
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
Don't be fooled by appearances.
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
You mean a woman?
Because it's not.
You know what I think?
Where the hell you been?
You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?
What?
How come you were in my truck?
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
Bravo!
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
Come where?
How do you do?
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
Are you French?
Where are we going?
So far?
Right.
Again.
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
You don't?
Rogers Hornsby?!?
Yes.
Heck, no!  What?!
Oh, I could die...
Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
Why not go to work for me?
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Okay.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
Yes.
Everybody's divorced.
Get out!
I told you I've never driven before!
The what?
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
I thought I was here to meet women.
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
Adam?!
I'm really sorry!
I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
Is that a birthday cake?!
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
What's baseball?
Well, do we just go on up?!
C'est bon, Monsieur.
Also...stay out of the "Adult Bookstore."
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
1959.
This must be very new.
Yeah?
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
The recovery is very impressive.
So, did you buy a movie?
You dial nine to get out.
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
Help you?
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
I'm afraid you've got to.
Well, where are you --
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
Good god.
No.  They all do.
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
Thirty -five years!
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
Watch this!
No kidding.  Who else would have done it?
What did you wish for, Adam?
Mutants?!
I want him to at least see the sky!
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.
You came back for these?
So where is your roommate, the model?
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
Eve?!
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
To bed?
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
Yeah! That's thinking.
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
Where?!
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
You did? A human ear?
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Why do you do it?
What color is it?
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Nobody.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
Then you got undressed.
Why are you here. Whatiya want?
Oh shit.
Frank? Can you stand up?
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Do you like my body?
What do you want?
Do you love me?
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
Those are my breasts.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Hello?
No thanks.
Yes.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Yeah?
What?
Do you want the car?
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Are you feeling okay?
What else is new? Right?
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Are you alright?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Why not?
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Yeah, but.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
What did you see?
You want to tell me about it?
That doesn't bother you, does it?
That's what I thought.
You were late.
What am I going to do?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
It's good to see you.
It's okay.
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
No Jeffrey!!
Come on out a minute, okay?
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
Up where?
Yes mother.
Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
Any tips on where these guys may be?
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?
What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!
What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.
I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.
You guys?
We're here brother.
What?! What are you doin'?
So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
Aye.
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
"What do we tell him about the guns and money?"
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
Is that right, Rambo?
Aye.
Oh, we're good man.
We've teamed up with a sex offender.
I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.
And number three, Dolly.
Can she I.D. them?
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
How many bodies, Greenly?
But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.
Promise me boys.
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.
Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!
But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct.
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
Open it!
Father, I'll do you right here.
Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
Dignan, it's --
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
Yeah, I saw it.
Calm down. Take a deep breath.
Where's the manager?
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Look at the treads on those.
OK. Go ahead.
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
As long as he gets out OK.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
This morning.
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
Don't panic, Anthony.
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
What exactly is this place? Freezers?
I don't think you will.
Yeah. As a girl.
Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to Scarecrow.
Uh-huh?
It's going back down.
Yeah.
What'd he get?
Why?
You're kidding.
And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Why'd you want to help us?
Future Man.
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
Cuba.
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
Where'd they come from?
That's Anthony.
Yeah.
Wait. Did he see us?
You don't celebrate til it's over.
Not even for emergencies?
OK, Bob.
It's true, Dignan.
How much could you grow? Realistically.
Did we get it?
I told you they were there.
The weed.
I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
Come on, Dignan.
Watch me.
Bullshit.
He's having a heart attack or something.
Do they let you --
Hold on --
I'm working on it.
Social issues. Crime prevention.
Ground defense.
Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
Well, I left some money in there.
No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
There was a mistake.
Let's talk about Conklin.
What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
Excuse me.
May I finish?
My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
Don't know.
Sit down.
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
Then what?
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
I'm sorry.
Conklin up front.
But it ends up the same.
He was at the campground yesterday.
So...
...but you're not -- you're not sure...
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
See that tram coming around the corner?
And you got to him before we could.
So when was I here?
No... Jason... please...
Where am I?
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
Some women like Dobermans --
Let's give him half an hour.
Do we know what this says?
We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.
A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
We must sue for peace.
Peace?!
What news of the north?
But if we have not caught Wallace --
His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
Good day to you, M'Lords.
The little cow is insane --
I'll wait... back there.
Stephen ready?
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
Good to see you again.
Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.
I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
Did it work?
You scare me.
This night is too beautiful to have again.
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
But you must have something to go on?
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
Um... can dad come this time?
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
Just. Like. Jason.
Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.
Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
What the fuck are you doing?
Are you stupid or what?
Ouch.
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
Not since we were kids.
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
Of course.
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
Why's that?
Because you're... different.
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
Oh? There's proof now?
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
I don't get it.
Then you think it might have worked out?
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
We'll find out soon enough.
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
Just don't drop the ball, okay?
Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
I thought I was the bad guy!
Here you go, buddy.
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
Oh, yes.
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
Thank you, but I hardly think --
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
Yes, Monsieur.
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
Yes, I come.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
It's not for sale at any price.
The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man.
There are only two other alternatives for him.
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
I didn't count the days.
Has it got a wow finish?
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.
Put them on the table.
It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
Because you're getting on that plane.
I don't understand. What about you?
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
He came from Paris with Rick.
Your work.
Good morning.
Go ahead.
I beg your pardon?
I said, ask your wife.
Thank you.
Had a close one, eh?
I understand.
Yes.
My bill.
May we proceed with the business?
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?
What, again?
I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
Yeah? Have a brandy?
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
Oh, it's my party.
Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans?  Rick, have you got these letters of transit?
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
What friend?
I have the letters right here.
It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while. There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville. I could be induced to arrange a passage.
Our expenses?
Sacha, she's had enough.
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
Are my eyes really brown?
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
For how long?
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
Boss, let's get out of here.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.
No more water, you said.
Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
What are you smiling about?  They'll be back.
I float.  You sink.  End of story.
What's so damn funny?
You can't make it.
Oh?  You've tried?
No.  that was the last one.
Keep painting.  Promise me.
Sonofabitch!
I can't even keep fish alive.
Look, I love the puppy.  I love you.  But I have to go.
No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
What's that, written on the sail?
What was inside?
That about sums it up.
Yeah?
Come on.  Try.
You too.
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
Anything else?
My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?
Which I didn't have.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
But chickens?
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
That's why you're a gambling man.
Cool ropes.
You were how long on this?
When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
To Wilson.
I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...
Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.
Thanks.  For everything.
They just want you to hire some new help.
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
I've never seen a lobster.
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
A movie *outside*?
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
I'm okay--I can walk.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.
They wanted a girl.
Nobody special enough, Curly.
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
"I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it."
So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--
I think I'd probably like the apple business.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
It's obviously an aborticide.
I don't know it.
But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.
I'm happy I amuse you.
It's just my heart.
You okay, Rose?
Shit. We don't know what he is.
I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.
They told me I was too old to serve.
You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that.
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.
We had to finalize the deal.
Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.
Just the last three weeks.
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.
Nice.
She had you tempting fate.
It's not true.
This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
You gotta be kidding me. Her?
How's that? He works for Gillette.
She up for this?
You'll be there?
Eight A.M. flight.
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you, Skippy.
Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
Why?
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
What -- What do we do?
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
Why?
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
I gotta go get a haircut.
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.
So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology?
Why?
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, "You're fired! Your whole team's fired!" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo --
King ain't gonna like this.
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
Stand up.
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
It's not history.
Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --
Who?
What are you doing?
I want a job, Giles.
All right. As what?
Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here...  It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business.  Bring a friend. I've plenty of room.
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
Last hand.
I get it.
Good night?
Not particularly.
I. sold the car.
In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer.
You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me.
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
Gambling's not about money.
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
Nothing about you.
What?
Great.
For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion. 
I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.
We all came from Africa, supposedly.
Do you believe in astrology?
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
I know that. But you can now.
They mean it.
Next time it'll be my neck.
Wait a minute...
Let it go.
Is it yes?
And your hand too.
I don't think we should meet again.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Who...
I'm off to a little watering hole. Why don't you join me? Relax.
So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
I can't give you a lift back tonight.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?
Where did you go to school?
Why four? And not three or five?
I don't think so.
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
Very impressive.
I just want the job.
He's paying out in stacks of 25.
Thanks for the information.
How do you feel, Jack?
Bruised.
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.
The key, goddamit, the key!
Where is the key?
Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
All right, then...
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Hello, bomb.
The only thing which exists is myself.
I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
Yes, Doolittle.
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
Doolittle...
Which one?
Any planets?
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
-- automatic channels open --
TALBY!
You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Doolittle! Help me.
What happened, Doolittle?
Oh yeah?
Yeah?
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
Oh, yeah?
Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.
Man, you got a bad attitude.
But the boss knows I always been loyal.
Some of us are trying to sleep.
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
It's a sweep.  C'mon.
Nobody there to sign for it, mon.  What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?
Which is none of your business...or mine.
What're you looking for?
So Max, what do you do with all your money?
Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--
Can you help me get her back?
What else can we do?
Are we in some kind of trouble?
Thank God.
First time I ever heard that.
So this guy walks into a bar and says...
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
So what are you gonna do about it?
Bent?
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?
The other ones?
You said you could help.
Well, not me personally.
These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.
And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
I'm looking for a lady who works here.
You don't want to.
A friend of your fiance's.
Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...
Say the words, "I understand."
You're crazy.
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
Straight.
Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
And she bought that?
You get it when I get her.
Feel like the dog's dinner.
Probably a touch of what's going around.
Tell everybody hey.
You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh.  I'd be pissed off too if I was her.
I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
I'm the victim here.
Hear me out.  This person I've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married--
Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
I'll give it my best shot.
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
Hawk.
Sorry.
Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
We've got to take this slow...
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
Yeah.
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
We are not stealing my mom's car.
Uh... dudes?
I think we should try sneaking in.
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.
It's my Bullworker.
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
I'm really sorry about that, man.
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
Go ahead, Jam.
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you.
Yeah.
The Chinese have a proverb: "That which appears too good to be true, usually is." There's gotta be a catch.
Simplicity, Hawk.
But we took the keys?
You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
Yeah.
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
"The Last Unicorn!" By Samantha Darko.
Dea ex machina...
Why did you make me flood the school?
Hey...
You mean soap?
I'm sorry.
Where are we going?
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
Hey. You OK?
My mom is gone.
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
Why? Is this about the book?
You're such a fuck-ass.
He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?
Oh, shit!
Would you like to talk about this friend?
Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?
I met a girl.
I think about girls a lot.
How many times have you seen Frank?
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
What did you want for Christmas that year?
What else makes you feel regret?
Where are we going, Donald?
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
Thank you.
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
Because you tell Mom everything.
Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
Okay, but it has to be a small one.
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
That's enough.
Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.
Beg pardon?
Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
Chut up!
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
You-betcha.
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
Really?
All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
Mrs. Leeman?
I hate her!
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
Yeah...
Okay... well, bye.
Loretta, shut it.
All right, they're makin' a movie.
We was robbed.
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
Okay?
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."
Nothin' too showy!
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
And wear a crown and everything.
Here I am, Father.
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
"My dear"...
Dear Sir... enclosed find check for $100.  Yours very truly...  Send that immediately.
Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly...
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.
You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.
Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
So! -- He's on your side, too.
I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
Give me that again!
Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
No, that wasn't it...
Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?
Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.  Notables from every land are gathered here in your honor --  This is a gala day for us.
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.  They don't come any better than you...
Now -- er --
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
What do you mean?
What is it?
All you do is profit from another man's misery!
A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
I don't understand.
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
I feel much better. Thank you.
You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...
Is he... dying then?
Want to come out?
Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
Merrick...
Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?
Not at all, John.
The Children. Where are your children
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Yes John?
No, John, not one that I can see.
I've heard.
The workhouse.
He's had his share of "smacks", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man.
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
Yes. John wants it.
And who might you be, sir?
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
Open up! I know you're in there!
Ah! It's my father!
WELCOME?
What's the matter?
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
No!
Erik. You don't understand.
The second note.
What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?
Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.
Don't talk nonsense.
But it IS! Look!
Looting and pillaging, eh?
What?
You DON'T like it, do you?
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
Well you started it.
Why should you care?
FIND the Rainbow Bridge?
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
You talking piffle, son?
It's always the women that start the trouble.
I... I... KILLED her...
What are YOU doing here?
Why should WE care?
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other.
I've got you!
Just say something cheerful.
Wait, Erik!
But HOW?
Sven!
I came to find my grandfather.
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
Vanish into thin air?
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
I know. I know.
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.
That's right.
Wasn't it, Keitel?
Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
Well I'M certainly not, either.
Thorfinn! You can't die!
No... he's not... not... there...
And keep your sword greased.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
Oh, baby, what's going on?
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
I don't have one.
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
I don't know any jokes about your name.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Probably see you at the book store.
You're sure? It's cold.
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
I don't know.
Yeah.
That's scary sounding.
Okay.
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
Where are you going?
No, it isn't that.
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
Happy Birthday.
Yeah.
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
I'm sure, I said.
But you weren't. I could tell.
I dropped you off after. You said --
Come up and see me... now.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
You had the whole human race pegged.
No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
yeah?
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
Cool.
I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.
Tomorrow?
I think I should go back.
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
I just walked in.
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
Look, I have to go. I have to think.
Guess what I'm wearing.
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
Pink.  There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718?  I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.
Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...
Clementine.
You have to stop this!
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
Oh, hey, Patrick.
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
'kay.
It's freezing out.
Oh.
Order me a pastrami for after?
How do you mean?
Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
It was a mutual decision.
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
It's an apartment.
Yeah?
Just wanted to let you know.
But I don't know how to polka.
What was that?
I'm staying with the Countess.
No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.
Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
What do you think?
Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
What are you doing?
So now you're bummin' around?
A job for me?
If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?
But Countess...
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
Time to play Spam in the can.
But Justin...
...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
Let me breathe, let me breathe...
They thought it said, "Liberatis me," "Save me," but it's not "me." It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself."
90 over 50 and falling... .
Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...
You wanted to see me, Admiral?
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible.  Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage.  We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew...
I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?
Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
I found one.
That's a negative, Starck.
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
Where has it been for the last seven years?
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.
What about it?
Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know."
We're leaving.
Weir is dead.
I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...
Captain Miller...
Captain Miller, you copy?
Sir.
Captain, we got a problem.
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
Skipper...
I just finished drying...
Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
Maybe one of the original crew?
Who?
What is it, Starck?
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
There's no one in the corridor but us.
We have to do something, oh God...
Where is she?
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean?
I mean...
I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them?
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
I'm worried about you.
What do you want, Vic?
Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
Are you alright?
You got a chisel round here?
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
'Course not. Strictly business.
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Me like-y.
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
What is that thing?
You two need a time-out.
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Yes, thanks.
That's good. That's uh... good.
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
Brad, can I talk to you a minute?
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
No. I want my money back right now.
Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.
Does Mom know you have company?
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?
Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
Do you want to take a quick swim?
I think we're making a lot of noise.
I didn't see you this morning.
Yeah?
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
Yes.
Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
Really?
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
What's Doug do in Chicago?
God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.
That little prick.
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
Can I come in?
I couldn't make it in time.
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
Thanks for picking me up.
'The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine Columbian.'  You look nice tonight.
Are you really nineteen?
You keep them.
Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
Aren't your parents asleep?
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
Where's Mike today?
Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?
Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...
You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
...and we're chock full of that!
I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda. I told him I knew what he was up to...  He says he's a photographer! But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked! He knows we're onto him!
Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking.
This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
I want to leave fast.
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
What limes?
What tape?
Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.
We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.
I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out.
Lucy is looking for you.
It's gone too far.
What is this?
What made you do it? Who paid you off?
May I see your license.
You realize...
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
Who the hell would you call?
Stop it.
We shot a skunk.
I think I know where a CB is.
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
I'd love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles.
Ohhh.
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
Doesn't your foot hurt?
How much you got to see the show?
He's dead.
What?
Two.
Seven.
'Eh, Chief?
Let's go!
What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --
Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I?
My clothes?
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
Huh.
Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
Frances.
I know, but --
There've been some calls.
No?
The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
Is Kaminski a Communist?
Of course.
I know that, Dad, but --
Francie, you know I can't do that.
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
Thank you.
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
See you next weekend?
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
Fifteen.
Why... yes.
...Not if I can help it.
Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh?  Hey!
Don't touch me.
But I'm not. The newspapers're --
Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
Well? What'd you think?
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
Oh no...
Serious, huh?
Well, the studio told me not to.
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy.
Don't start, Farmer.
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!
Why are you always leaving me, Harry?
There's just one more thing.
What's that?
Anyway... if you need me...
Frances! Frances!
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.
Fine!
You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
Why are these all opened?
Then why did you bring them?
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
I see.
...Did you really say that?
This whole thing is a joke!
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
No!
You're kidding.
What?
You drove him to his torment.
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
Friend?
What is this?
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
So have I
How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
What kind of God is He to will this?
Smell the air. Wonderful.
Brother and sister still?
I thought I'd never see you again!
No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
Are you having me on?
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
Do you really think I'm mad?
These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
I resent God's monopoly.
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
I have always loved him.
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
Are you a physician?
Ah. An explorer.
I heard.
Creature? A... human like creature?
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow.
Any particular reason?
It still hurts?
You saved my life.
Ow!
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
Ned!
Don't call him.
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?
Best over...
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
Cowboy.
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
So do I just follow you?
Why do you want to stop?
I'm exhausted.
Where are the keys to the motor home?
Come again?
Yes.
Was? As in not anymore?
Yes.
Didn't like it, did ya?
No, I didn't.
You won't let him touch her?
Now, is your shit together?
You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
That happens, you'll get it back.
I promise.
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
Not many.
Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers, that the Bureau, the Rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally?
I wasn't scratching!
What the fuck was that about?
What the fuck is wrong with you --
Gotcha!
Hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent.
Sight seein'.
What'd ya see?
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
Is it me? Is it my fault?
Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
No, I didn't.
Keep your voice down.
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
That's what you look like.
You know what you look like?
No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
My shit is together.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
Don't say my name.
Wow...
Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases --
Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning.  A name?
Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
Entering my scan now...
Shit.  Think we're had.
Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
You don't know that.
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
So she picks the women, we pick the programs.  Seals?
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
No, ma'am.
I'll work on it, ma'am.
Hey.  You okay, Flea?
Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.
Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but it's gotta go out.  Five... four... three...
Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death.
Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine.
Just a coincidence?
Unless you Whiskey Run.
So why're you even considering it? Are you?
Just like you would be.
So dump on me.
Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
Well, not this.  I was doing the Pentagon scene few nights ago.  Got some fresh stuff -- about you.  You may be in a hostile camp.  I think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn.
I saw an article...
I'd sure like to know who.
You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
I can't go out.  Not like this.
Just askin'
Chief, sir, I don't understand why --
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not going to get anywhere.  You might as well put me in the cage.
Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured?  Didn't you even think about that?
Got it.
All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready?
You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.
What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
I don't know.  Seems...
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
You okay?
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
So you made it.
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
And you think this creature is one of them?
I got pretty close.
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
Who was that French guy, anyway.
My life sucks.
Can I use some?
Call me Charlie.
You don't understand, I can get us information...
We? I don't think so.
Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
Make sure they find that nest before it's too late.
They didn't make it.
Have them sealed off.
That is our job.
The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur.
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.
Contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape.
How do I do that?
Just don't.
Go ahead!
Not again...
Settle down, Alex...
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
I don't know.
You said "the Commander.
Hi Brandon.
It's okay. Listen-
Okay, now. But-
Lt. Madison, GO.
Systems register functional.
Systems register functional.
... What does that mean?
Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
You Okay, Alex?
The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.
"Assault on Voltareck III."  Episode... 31 I think.
We're doing episode 31?
We're alive!
Hey... Hey where are you going?
never doubted you for a second.
I heard it too.
Closer?  I can try.
Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.
Then how did he find out about the device?
Commander...
Well... Sort of...
A model, only as big as this.
What kind of signal?
Oh, right, sorry.
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
I capture Quebec leading an Army by river fordings through Maine... If we don't do it, the British will come down Champlain, take back Ticonderoga and attack us in the spring.
Is that a fact.
The army needs you.
The army can survive without me.
They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food.
They love Reed and his inquisition! I think they hope to share in his disgusting profits!  It's becoming the American way!
You, you just need a new flint, General.
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
Misunderstood what!?
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.
That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do you feel?
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
What is this?
Yes, I believe so.
General Lee is detained captain...
Colonel Reed...
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!
No, please; an advance on your salary.
You must be very rich.
I'm very aware of that.
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
Nathanael, I'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army, to harass Cornwallis.  Marquis, you must go with him.
Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
Slavers capture them and bring them here.
The word 'minuet' finds its source in minitus, which is Latin meaning 'small' or 'orderly'.
Remember, George, "It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong."
Just because they are born?
And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it.
I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat.
And that's for the airport.
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
I don't know how I could've missed you with that shirt on. It's the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color. Right?
You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
You serious?
You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.
What three hundred grand?
Why would I do that?
Your wife a Lakers fan?
It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
I'm looking at you.
That's what I'm doing.
A marker's like a check, Harry.
I know what a marker is.
Part of it, yeah.
He drown?
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -–
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
I had to tell 'em something.
How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?
Really.
You have it?
You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
Twenty seven hundred.
Yeah. That was a good party.
Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
We talk different?
Martin, look at me.
Wait. How about this?
At that point, basically, that has to be it.
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
We call you a taxi.
You broke in?
Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.
No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
Then you've read it?
Depends, who pays?
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -–
Momo could buy it, I could run it for him. Show some Cagney films.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
Hello, Doris.
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention.
Damn mind of it's own.
What day is it?
What is your first name?
What other choices have we got?
Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?
A what?
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?
Get up.
If you get it back in one piece.
I know I know, two ways to do anything --
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.
Can't you use something else?
What is it?
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
You're late.
Go on.
Nope.
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
The guy. He just came this way.
You just shoot at something?
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
Showing you what?
Victims of what?
Murphy to Epps.
They went crazy.
We hit land.
What?
I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
It's funny.
Morning.
You're up late.
Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.
How're you feeling?
Say what?
What about the gold?
What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
I thought you say Tuesday.
Who?
What is it now?
I guess.
Yeah, I heard about that.
That was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this.
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?
I'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds.
Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
Jesus, look at this guy.
Hi Josh.
Why?
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.
Hi.
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
Does Oomie really like this show?
I remember every minute of that party.
God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
Are you sure?
He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
Gross!
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
We still have to go in there sometime.
Where are we going?
There he is...
JOSH!
What was that all about?
I know a party we could go to...
I totally, totally hate you.
He gives me a total boner!
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
Hello?
Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
Wow... finally.
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
Well, we won't keep you.
It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl.
Shhh!
A what?
Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room.
Norman.
Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.
You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.
Hey, where are you going?
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
Do you have any old Indian records?
So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
What about her? Would you go out with her?
Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
Well are --
I - I'd really rather not...
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
Wow, this is so cool...
What? Why?
What is that?
How can you be so sure?
Uh... hello?
So, what happened?
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
...so... is he your boyfriend now?
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
I... I don't think so.
Does that mean you don't like me?
In whatever way you think I mean.
Where did you get this?
I hate sports.
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
You know what my number one fantasy used to be?
What?
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
What do you want?
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
Why would she be hiding from me?
Why? What did she tell you?
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
What do you mean?
I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
There is no reason for fear.
-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-  -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
How; we don't know where they are?
Pleasant journey?
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
Finish your tour?
You said "of course" you'd need the donkey. Why "of course"?
Got me out of trouble.
I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out-  -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you.
Have you got it?
The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers?
...misfire... it jammed...
In my town, when I was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place.  But he was not the problem. He had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother was not the problem.  One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem came when they were both free togther. The two became different from either alone.  Alone they were only brutes. Together they became lethal, together they killed.
What happened to them?
Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water?  They're only lions, yes?
They're used to people in trees, not in a clearing.  It may be tight.
I'll have to.
How many do you think they've killed?
Did it look like this in your mind?
For you.
Thank you, Samuel.
You like him, don't you?
You've known him long?
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
What do you want with my baby?
No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
Does he ever mention me?
Certainly.
Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
What do you think?
I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy.
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
Is this the spot?
Sorry!
What are you doing up here?
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
I can't believe a person could actually live like this.
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
What now, Brainiac?
"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"
It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.
It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
And now you're going to eat it?
Did you find anything at Dana's?
What happened?
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
Does it have any favorites?
You finished here?
Are you telling me how to drive?
It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
Wonder what?
Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
Do you want this body?
Really!  Is it gone?
Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
Print is dead.
I want you to have this. 
Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
Can I help you?
All right.  What is it?
Were you recently in the bathroom?
Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.
What now?
Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?
Looked at with your eyes.
I don't know.  Talk to it.
Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
Ray -- Something's here.
Boy, that was a rough one.
Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
Do you believe in God?
What's he talking about?  Choose what?
Quite so.  Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve Rome...
I should at least have you, don't you think?
Tribuus... tomorrow.
Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.
Damn him!  I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that.
You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
Insubordination.  To the Emperor... and the Senate.
Caesar, ignore them.
Take grain away from the army?
Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.
Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
"Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens."  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
You on your way to trial, too, general?  Or do you think they've already had our trial?
Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
I see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army.
It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.
I can see that...
I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I won't even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here.  I know what you're trying to do:  kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands.  The only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you're a very important individual.  You make me feel good about my investment!  And that puking pig Jerses -- he won't even discuss you.  Both of you have clamped mouths!  But I love all my fighters -- I'll find out about your family.  And about you.  That I promise.
I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome.
You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
Hello.
Aren't you eating?
What?
This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
But could you try?
You sure you really want to?
You mean the one who --
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
I said I think it is.
I don't understand --
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
Because it isn't true.
Are you going home?
Yes.
You really will?
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
I just don't think it would work.
No, Benjamin.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Are you listening?
There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
What for?
I want you out of here.
Benjamin?
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
Did you get a room?
A single. Just for myself, please.
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
No. 
What do you drink? Bourbon?
All right then.
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
Oh. Well, goodnight.
What?
Do you understand what I said?
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes?
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
On your first time --
Oh.
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
There!
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
Calm down, Benjamin.
Now let's keep going here.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
Man, is this interesting.
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
That's enough.
There's nothing to tell.
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
Let's drop it.
Well, I'm not.
Are you?
Don't start acting hurt.
You wouldn't.
Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
Sure.
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
But I don't want you to make up something.
I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
Goodnight, Benjamin.
Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
I do.
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
That has nothing to do with it --
Oh no.
Thank you very much, sir.
Thank you.
No, it's not --
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
That's quite a statement.
Have you a minute now?
Well?
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
With the pearls?
Like dancing?
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
Dictation.  You know...
No -- why? -- should I?
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Chasing around.
I'll do anything for you.
Please do not be frightened, Madam.
Why do you look at me like that?
And then --?
I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 
I'll not denounce you.
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
Grusinskaya --
I'll go -- good-bye.
Don't.
Not at all, sir. 
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
How's the beautiful lady?
Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
Oh, let the poor devil alone.
For me?
Send his bags up to my room.
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes.
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
Yes --
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
No -- only occasional jobs. 
Movies?
Moreover...
Can't you understand me?
Tomorrow morning.
You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --
What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
Of course -- of course. 
Insolent young cub!
And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down.
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
No water -- What a place!
Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester. 
What?
Let us cancel the engagement.
Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- I think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance --
What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
I wish to be alone.
Last night?... There was no applause.
What is this insolence?
Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
-- We must do something...
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.
Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.
Here you are! Two rich people!
What? He's going to be all right!
Well, make it stop!
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
Whadaya say?
What's up?
Well, uh... No.
Don't mention it.
What happened to your hand?
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
Sure.
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
At what?
Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.
What?
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
I know you do, so that's why --
Never.
That's right.
If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it?
A future. The only future I've got.
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
That's just Lilly's way.
You already went back to work.
The long end. Big con.
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
Open your door.
What?  What for?
I went out to Delmar.
I don't think I need it.
No! Because I --
That's natural.
Gun?
What?
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
No question, huh?
No thanks, I'm not thirsty.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
Impressive, Blake.  Where'd you learn how to do that?
That's it?
Carter.
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
Carter.
It's Amy Kramer.
Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
Jimmy, what are you doing?
Checking out your place.
What the --
Alright, I was wrong.  There is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
Oh, so now it's my fault?
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
No.
What are you doing here?!
I came to see you.
I'm okay.
I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
Linda!  He killed Linda!
Looks great.  It does.
You just dropped a shitload on him... give him some time to digest it.
Yeah.
What's this?
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun stuff!
God ... this can't be true.
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
It was there when I found him this morning.  It looks like some kind of letter or number or --
Where's the baby?!
Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!
It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
There you are.  Who was that boy?
Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.
Yes?
Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
What do you know about Michael?
Who else knew I had the baby?!
Hm?
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
You know what gets me?
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
Let's talk about it some other time.
And how were things?
I dunno, boy.
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
I dunno.
Go live in a safe-deposit box--with your things. LOOSELEAF Jesus--I wouldn't want to be married to him.  You know?
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
You're an imbecile.
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
You've come to the right man.
Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
Insurance!
It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
Hello.
Do you know who Wanda June is?
College!
They were in the same creative writing class.
Excellent!
He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?
We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
They're not engaged.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
Why don't you go to bed--son.
Can't it keep till morning?
A hundred dollars!
What's this?
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
I have a brain.
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
You're wrong.
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
Yes.
And what is his most cherished possession?
If he wants to go.
It's a big and busy funeral home.
It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
It seems highly intelligent to me.
Blue soup?
Sounds quite beautiful.
Honor, I suppose.
This is suicide.  Go get the police.
No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
Are--are you crying, Penelope?
You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
I thought she was a widow.
There's going to be no bloodshed here.  I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight: with words. The truth.  Am I correct?
I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
You're old--so old.
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
I'm high as a kite.
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
Poison.
I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
You're too modest.
New lives begin!
And you went home unannounced, too?
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
Jesus.
Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?
You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?
Thank God!
I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything.  Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!
No.
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
I was afraid to ask.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
I hate that thing.
Who have you been talking to?
No.
What?
Yeah.
Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.
Everything stays as it is!
I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
I know.
Something happens to my confidence.
Did you see him?
For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
I'm sorry.
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
I'm amazed.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in.
You've got to fight from time to time.
Or get eaten alive.
Start with the smallest weights. Every week add a pound or two.
What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
Minors aren't allowed at fights.
"Happy Birthday, Wanda June!"
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
Do you want to take a session?
What do you mean?
Hello. You want some information?
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
Do you know where she lives?
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
You're not a film producer, are you?
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
You're not a private detective either, are you?
No.
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
Tijuana.
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.
Look, I really don't know your daughter but...
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Did you find out where she was?
Well, what do they know?
What have you found out?
I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
No.
I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
Oh yeah? I've done a lot of good stuff. Shorts, features. No major roles it's true. But good stuff.
No.
I want to meet Ratan.
Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
What?
I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
But I...
To his own daughter?
Jake'll take care of me.
Yes.
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
No, no. I just took it.
Took it?
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
Because if you are...
I'm a file clerk.
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
I don't know.
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
No, thank you. I have my car.
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
Oh, at the dentist's?
Do you often model for Glaucus?
Me! No. Of course not.
No. 
Oh, my. We're too late.
Well, I really don't drink...
I <u>think</u> I see it.
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
Want to join me in some cartwheels?
That wasn't very scary.
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
... which I hope will make you very happy.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
How do you do?
And why is that?
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
What about the draft?
That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for <u>fun</u>? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?
Huh?
I'd have liked to talk to him.
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
Will they really teach me to shoot?
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
Eh?
Harold, calm down! This is...
Yes!
He... he loved me.
Yes... Yes. You look...
She's done it.
She certainly has.
So... You're Kirsty, huh?
What do you mean?
The boxes! I TOLD you.
Are you crazy?
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
Well... G'bye.
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
You were burned by some organic acid.
If he's here, this is worse than I thought.
It's almost over!!
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
Grounded? Who's grounded?
In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
"One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.
We've installed a very handy timer. Set it, walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to use...
Don't move. We --
No. Don't --
I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up.
What took you so long?
Not from you.
Well good n-
But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
Doesn't sounds like him.
He's just pushy.
But it's not true, is it?
Just take it slowly.
Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.
Who are you?
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
Nobody escapes us.
We've got such sights to show you --
Please listen to me --
No.
You're Julia, right?
What about Larry --
Wedded bliss?
Help me.
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
You would be. They tore me apart.
She'll tell them everything...
Which is where?
Sure.
I was here this afternoon.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
How are you doing through there?
Look, I'm going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company.
Larry....
Oh baby.
What's wrong?
I don't know where to begin...
That depends.
I... suppose so, yes.
I suppose not.
You'd like the house.
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
Of course. Every day.
Really?
I have to talk to you.
I'm afraid it's true.
What do we do if there isn't?
Oh!
Steve. Thank God you came.
What's next?
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
Oh, so what's the point then?
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
What?
What band?
Like fuck you are.
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.
What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --
I have all of the others.
Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this?
That's what I said.
Anna Moss.
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
"Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz. "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling.
Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
Is that it?
Yeah.
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Good weekend?
Well, I'll just make it for you.
I always hated this song.
Laura?  Are you okay?
Maybe I should talk to him.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
What?
No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
Nevermind.
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
I told you I slept with him.
You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.
I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
I can't talk right now.
Me?
Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
I can see why you say that.  Look, I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared.  I just wanted you to know, that's all.
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
Mission accomplished.
Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something. Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.
But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
Wanna go to dinner?
I called Dan Koretzky because he --
I'm going to talk to you.
I know.
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
I'm sure it isn't.
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
That way.  You?
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
We're not there yet, Justin.
Nice.
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
Then you didn't know Richard later on.
It's not mine.
Basil the II.
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
You have an active imagination.
I have friends.
Where?
At the moment?  Carl Smith.
What about me?
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
No one knows you're here?
The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.
It's beautiful.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
I must be insane.  Leaving work, ditching cops.  All to follow a murderer.  A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same.
I'm not even sure why.
That would be difficult to explain.
You kill with your left hand?
What is it like?  Being you?
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall.
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
All fashionably without heads.
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that.
You're an asshole, Moran.
It's that important?
Who is it?
Requiem acer'nam donaei-
Your name is Conor?
Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?
Pheasant.
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
Yes.  Always.
This is madness!
It is the truth.
This can't be.
This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
Me arm hurts.
You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez.  We're raised as riders.
It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
And you?
That is not me.
I have no future husband.
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
Not so scared.
They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
We must talk.
Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke.
My father taught me.
He knows I'm here.  How?
How did you find me?
I haven't drunk this much since-
I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid.
You're insane.
You're wrong.
What were _you_ looking for?
But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
You're one of William's kids, huh?
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
Sort of a Jack London style?
I'll keep you in mind.
According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
Mr. Burns --
Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure.
If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
Call Duffy!
Out of the mouths of babes.
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
I have a lunch date. I just want --
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
No!
Keep away --
Please! Will you just --
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Thanks...
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
Then what does he want with you?
What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
Exclusive? That's great.
Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!
Where do you think you're going?
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
I'd like to think.
All the words you've got.
Railroad tickets.
Double-crossing swine!
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
Lafayette two-one-hundred.
No, you don't! Walter!
Wait a minute!  Let go there!
How was that for a tight squeeze?
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.
What!
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
Are you referring to me, Madam?
Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here.
Let's see the money.
You said it!
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
I don't know --
Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?
A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
Better let us in on it, Mollie.
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
You ain't gettin' out o' here!
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
Just a minute, Johnson!
Where'd you get this?
Where is he?
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
I did.  Hold the wire.
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you.
I won't.
Got you, Williams!
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!
Where's the old lady?
Who is it?
Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still here.
Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
Where are they gone? You know where they are?
They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!
Hey --
For heaven's sake, why not?
You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.
Here's the picture of my wife.
What's he want?
That was a googly!
Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?
This is going too far, young man.
Do you know any swear words?
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
...and four and five...
Boy, that was some air-raid.
Air-raid?
What is it?
Where?
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
What about it?
It looks....foreign.
Why didn't they say that before you started?
What is it, pet?
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
No, Mother! It's War! War!
It was the best time of his life.
Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
It's all better left unsaid, Grace.
You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
Molly!
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.
I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
Ma, Tiny's in.
I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
He left!
Hey, um...  ...what kind of animal is that?
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
That's not something to joke about.
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
How long have you been running this place?
You mean John Wayne?
No, no I think it's really interesting.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, "do you smoke?" The guy say, "yeah"... the devil say, "great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had."
Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit.
Thanks.
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
Go around him.
Well, I got some bad news and some bad news.
Officers, officers what can I do for you today? I ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about.
What I need are some answers. 
Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
How long is that gonna take?
Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.
Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
What? I didn't hear anything.
You find something, Georgie?
OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
This is way too fucked up for words.
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
What are you doing?  ...no, stop... please, please.
Who's your Daddy!
We gotta break it open.
That's it?
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
Your Spidey senses tingling.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help.
Yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with.
And?
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
French?
You decide. Today is your day.
Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang up on you?
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
I am sleepy.
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
My little French.
Urgh.
I just want to talk.
You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!
Please. I look a mess.
I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
Hunh.
You what?
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
Progress!
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.
My brother is discreet.
My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan.
One night stand?
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.
Rose, please go away.
Where?
You do?
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
I like you, too, Nathan.
I'm sorry about my parents.
Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
Oh, and the sun block?
Come on.
I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
It's perfect!
You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
Who from work?
Your entire body?
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
Was that okay? I mean, was I able to... satisfy you?
I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
Really?
So he's doing okay?
I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
Yes.
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
Ugnh.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
I've never been to Louisville.
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
To win.
I'll make it up to you.
That seems a shame. The night is young.
Yeah? Why?
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
Where do I sign?
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
Aren't you gonna go over and talk to him?
So does Eddie.
Well, we won't.
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
Well, here it's half.
Fifty per cent?
Aaaahhhh!
Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
Quit. He's too good.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
Aw, Eddie.
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
That's right. When?
Yeah, sure has.
Couple of bucks.
What time does the bus leave?
Around.
So why go to college?
Fifth of scotch?
Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
You got it all in your head?
When you've got money, you'll pay.
I've got something in my bag.
Who is it?
What happened?
What is it, Eddie?
Where's Bert?
Where do you come from?
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.
That's what the game's all about.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
I quit, Eddie. I can't beat you. Willie, give him the stakes.  You got yourself a pool player.
It is not arguing to speak the truth.
Yes.
Who?
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
Shhh... don't talk.
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
Yes.
You and that damned garden.
What's that, Dad?
There are more this year than last.
... and Rigel.
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
I was so scared.
I'm home now.
What did he talk to you about?
Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
That's quite a story.  You know that, don't you?
How did it get Mrs. McKeltch?
Jimmy, calm down!  What happened? Tell me what happened!
They'll get us.
Mom.  I gotta talk to you.
What do you want?
You have to leave the White House.
You're being paranoid.
We're losing them.
There's good news and bad news.
Can't this thing go any faster?
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
What'd I say?
Get us out of here!
What're you doing?
With your permission, Mr. President, I'd like to remain my your side.
We've been collecting planes from all over but...
How do you know?
It's doing what?
You can't go. Call them back.
Yes, I am.
You're late.
You know me...
Dick-weed.
So, what do you do for a living?
Oh. Sorry.
I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?
Stop it.
You sure?
Yes.
Peace? No peace.
Alexandretta. Now we know.
Yes. Now we know.
Marcus!
Henry, the pen --
The Word of God...
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
Are you expected?
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
Let me tell you another "bedtime story," Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
Are you sure?
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
Don't wander off.
Mine, too.
Knock it off. You're not mad.
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!
It's important!
But what are you doing here?
He was actually there? You saw him?
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
Will you take it easy!
So did I.
Dad!
This is intolerable!
Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
What about Marcus?
That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
We didn't talk. We never talked.
Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.
This is your last chance.
Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
Just a routine inspection tour.
I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me.
There are no stories anymore.
You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.
Step on it, Short Round!
I ride with you, Indy?
What does it mean, Indy?
This is Nainsukh -- from the village. They bring him here to dig in the mines.
Let up on the brake!
No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
That's far enough!
Give me the stones!
No, the stones are mine!
What'd he say?
And then they took their children.
What?!
What's happening?
I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety.
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
Yes.
I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.
I get it!
Give me your hat...
What for?
Try me.
Arrrgh!
It wasn't him.
Yes.
Where are we?
What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
Why don't we go home?
No.
You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
Are you threatening me?
The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
No.
You've heard of U.S.T.?
Loading a gun.
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
Hear voices don't I.
What was that?
Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
It can't take that long.
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
Gone where?
You need ID in there?
You mean...just leave.
Use my credit cards.
It's illegal.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
Oh yeah, to what?
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
The beach.
The sand.
She doesn't seem to understand.
Wait.
To the hotel. To register.
You really like that shirt?
What did that cost?
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
It's embarrassing.
I don't know!
Relax. Make your mind a blank.
Yeah...You've fallen for her.
What next!
Probably.
haka xuki. What's that mean?
Then, why'd he lead us here.
I can't handle that thing.
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
I can always flush you down the toilet.
Rene?
Now, you're too suspicious.
She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.
What are you doing?
Sorry...
Doesn't matter.
Oh, I can't.
Nice?
I knew you were trouble.
**?!! 
You have nothing...
Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.
I have a new client.
That crazy guy?
It's just money.
Enough ROmance.
That name's familiar.
It is to me too.
It may have been affected.
Fine. You look fine.
Well...
Don't you want to get out?
You'll feel better
What?
Just give me the keys.
What?
As if your mind's not all there.
I am sort of scattered.
You are.
Why do you do it?
If I was with you, I wouldn't
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
...Naw. Made that up.
They left. I had to go with them.
Why?
Why did they leave?
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
Why?
Get us one.
Hong Kong.
I asked him.
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
I can't fly it.
They asked about you.
Why did you, then?
I encouraged you to come here. My fault as much as yours.
How?
Do something!
That's twenty feet high.
What could you find in this place?
I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
Wait.
It doesn't hurt.
Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.
Instant rice...?
Hey, baby. What's wrong?
How long?
Three hours.
Are you all right?
I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. Boundaries of their constraint. Kentucky state law about. I want you to drop everything.
What does that do?
When's the air date?
Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on "60 Minutes"?
You can't take that... It's personal property...!
No, no, we're fine...
If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk.
Mike... Mike... Mike...
What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
I can take her.
Did you say Berman?
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
...you fucked me!
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
How do you like your coffee? Black?
Should I just take the documents now?
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
Good. But Jeff...
What does this have to do with my testimony?! I told the truth! It's valid and true and provable!
What about now?
What's happening?!
Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
Object to the form of the question!
Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
Jeff's a premiere golfer... What are you, a two handicap?
Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. Most people consider what they're saying... social skills... Jeffrey just charges right ahead.  Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff...
"Research..."  You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil...
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
Is that... one person?
Why in God's name would I want...?
Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
It was a gift from a client.
Got any symptoms?
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
I'm happy for you, pal.
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
Who was that?
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
Why would you be here?
Gotcha.
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
He'll regret this.
Oh, for the love of...
He's passionate.
I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.
Have you tried the duck?
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
Yes? Marylin?
She held that against you?
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
I don't have a ring!
Fabric and fringe.
Hi.
You don't like me?
Those are gifts.
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
Marylin?
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
Wait! He works for YOU?
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Marylin.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
Miles Massey.
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
Shit.
Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
...arty farty!
I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
Rex, please.
Ah.
I don't know. I can assume...
Video.
And she had private investigators assisting her.
Sorry.
Extinguish?
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
Why—uh—she's all right, sir.
Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.
What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
You're going to finance him, I suppose.
Oh, no.
No.
Peter Warne! 
Oh, no—no.
Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
What happened?
Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.  We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New York—and if we didn't go, she might lose it.
Me? Forget it, son.  I got millions.
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you—  scram.
You must have me confused with—
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
That, I suppose, makes everything—uh—quite all right.
Who are you?
You'll find the showers—and things—right back of the second cottage. 
I can't go out like this.
Must be the Spring.
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
Next week "East Lynne."
Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old woman—a trip like this.
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
Of course it is.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride—
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxation—a warm heart—and a loving nature.
Well, take them off.
know—but—
was so scared—that it scared—
I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter?
No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
I wish you wouldn't talk too much. We let a car get away. 
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
What happened?
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
You bet I did.
Eight o'clock tonight.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
In about fifteen minutes.
What's the matter?  Where's your husband, young lady—
Husband?
Hey, what's this? Wearing Papa's things? Now that's cute. That's what I call real lovey-dovey. Yessir.
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
That she's going to marry somebody else.
Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
Go on. Go on send the telegram.
Who?
What's up?
Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see?  A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what I always say.
What's on your mind?
Five G's—or I crab the works.
I can use a smart guy like you.
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
Yeah—the "big boy"—the Boss of the outfit.
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, see—and—
Sh-sh-sh—! Soft pedal, you mug!—before I— What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thing—and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
Gee! That musta been terrible.  I guess he had it coming to him though. But don't you worry about me. I don't talk. I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids.
What was his voice like?
All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.
Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
Keep saying what?
Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying here?
Can you get some sworn statements?
All right, all right.  Break it up.
I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in New York, you had drinks and, under the influence discussed killing Kennedy, is that not so?
Why?
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
...Oswald?
You know damn well who it is.
I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
What was so appealing about Houston?
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
Are we going away, Daddy?
Four to six.
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name "Oswald" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.  The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?  Guy Banister.  Banister has someone using the name "Oswald" to buy the trucks.  Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity.
I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right?  It proves he's a liar.  Keep on it, Bill. 
I'm not sure I understand.
I wouldn't imagine where.
No.
David Ferrie.
Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
Did they live?
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.
Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
Between six and seven seconds.
When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
How many men?
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
He's done it before.  Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro.  No big deal.  In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket.  Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...
Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
How much more?
You have other information?
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
The assassination, Jack?
HOLD IT, CHIEF...
Can I help you?
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
I know. That's why I went.
I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
Who?
That's not what they're tellin' me.
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody.
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
She wants to go back to work.
We are. Don't worry about it.
Help yourself.
I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
Are you really a bail bondsman?
Is it dark?
You're not tired of it?
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
If you're having some.
It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
My ass ain't the same.
"American President"
And Annette's it for you?
Sandra Bullock. You know her?
I go back to work tomorrow.
You talk them into it?
They seem to like the idea.
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
Has he hinted around?
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
What do you do when he comes home?
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
The feds. It's evidence.
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
Then you're out and you get nothing.
He's liable to shoot you.
That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?
Uh-huh.
I didn't use you, Max.
We're partners.
Spain.
I beg your pardon?
And cooperate? You might get probation.
You know what we want.
Then how do you know he sells guns?
I'm recording this.
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
I'm sure that was the idea.
Uh-huh.
Was she there?
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
There was a guy with Melanie?
It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?
I'm waiting for the phone.
Yeah, do you like it?
I knew it.
This fella Beaumont, they say what happened to him?
Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much.
Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
I just came here to talk.
Baby, I didn't --
I bet you come here on a Saturday night, you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass.
You told em? You told em it's me?
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
I don't know. One of your friends.
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
Four years?
What for?
Want a Metrix?
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
So where did you go?
That was taken at a place called "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then?
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
Must of made quite an impression.
Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.
I'm going to wait in the car.
Okay.
I dunno.
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
What did he do?
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
Well, you the one in motherfuckin' charge.
Louis?
Came outta where?
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses.
Getting there.
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
Across the street a Great Western. It goes in a trust account. You'll need to fill out an Application for Appearance Bond, an Indemnity Agreement, a Contingent Promissory Note. That's the one, if Beaumont skips and I go after him, you pay the expenses.
Did the police contact you?
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
She got off, huh?
Uh-huh.
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
She was afraid.
I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it.  I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?
Who is it?
He ain't here right now.
Get me out of here.
Are you all right?
What do you want from me?
Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.
Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you?  What's going on? How can you just turn away?  What about the others?
Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?
What are you talking about?
Hey, wait!
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
No. Not really ...
Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
What? By myself?
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
Carlson? Is he new here?
Not according to my charts. Do you have an appointment?
I'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files.
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
What do you think?
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
Wait. Don't.
'Cause she's always on your mind.
They weren't human!
Show me Della!
I know.
How come? The army?
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
Where are they?
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
Then don't bug me.
Oh?  Where you going?
This isn't happening.
Oh God!
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.
Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember.
So why tell me now?
How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
I no from around here.
You got a nice tan, though.
Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are you? I haven't seen you in what, five, six, years?
Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.
Still married, Jake?
What's goin' on Paul?
Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild.
Why not?
A car accident.
You got lucky.
He's not part of the program.
It's locked!
We can't lead him into the other hull!
Can't shut em' down from here.
Sergeant!
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
Sergeant!
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
Jesus, God!
You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Rizzo, he's out there.
Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.
What's this?
You wanna release your air tanks?
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
She needs a little time.
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
No.
You killed him?
Kicker!
How do you know?
Something's wrong.
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
Azrael can you repeat that?
You're not going anywhere.
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
Son! -- Out of the water now!
All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.
Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...
He's trying to sink us!
I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.
You're very tight, y'know?  Right there.
Where is he?
It's three feet deep, Martin
Can you do that?
Home... New York?
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.
I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins.
Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
He lost it on the way up.
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.
Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then I guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck.
Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach?
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...
Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
How can you tell?
...Nothing.
What happened?
What the hell?
Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!
Think the tide's with us?
You picked her up on the ferry.
I didn't know her.
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
We're not even sure what it was.
Leg of lamb this time?
You love sharks?
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
Yep.
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
What have you got there, Lenny?
I've got all these signs here...
I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs --
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
What's that supposed to prove?
Over there!
I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state.
Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.
I don't think so.
I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
But you copy my work every week.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days.
Um, hi?
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
What, you mean as friends?
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
Yup.
Yup.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
I have no idea how to spit this out.
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid.
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.
It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.
Yeah.
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
Well, it can really only go two ways.
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.
Hello?
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
I actually know this one.
But you're old!
Please don't get a divorce! God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife.
No thanks. I'm off pills.
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
Juno? What's going on?
So Juno, how did your maneuver go last night?
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
Think you can narrow it down for me.
Please stop now.
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?
I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!
What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
The Penny Saver sucks.
Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
They're yellow.
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.
Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
You lose!
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
You dropped this.
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
I'm cool.
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it?
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
Sure.
What happened to Adele?
Okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? Well then let's start with Adam and Eve and the snake.
...I do.
...and I think I know why.
What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
All set?
What's that?
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
What are you going to do?
What happened?
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
Yes. Altogether.
Yes.
Were they wearing condoms?
Shit.
What do you think?
But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.
Yeah.
I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
You know like in "The Wonder Twins" they share everything.
Well, those guys share everything, right?
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
I hate this game.
Man, this guy is really good.
Yeah. She's only 13.
Yeah.
I don't understand why you do that.
Why I do what?
That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
What are you talking about?
So.
So really, it's good luck.
Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big.
Casper, where's Telly.
Casper, where is he?
You sure?
Come on. It'll be fun. We'll just bug out. There should be a bunch of people. It'll be fun I promise.
Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
Because, you know why. You know.
I wouldn't believe it?
How old are you?
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
Hello.
Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?
Hell yeah. I love. I love sex.
Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?
Yep.
Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
Yeah.
How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.
No. I was just kidding.
Mom.
Shh.
Where does everyone sleep?
To come?
I can't man.
What do you mean, no?
You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?
What do you want?
Then let's narrow it down.
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
The message!  I figured out--
He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
Sorry.
I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!
Not really.
The game's over.  You lost.
1985.  Hans Korshaud.
Why did he?
Why did he what?
Uh huh.
Is your dad here?
That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
How do you know that?  Did he say something?
Who told you that?
What is it, dad?
Whaddaya got, Nolan?
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
No.  I told him to.  I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
We're going to work on the message.
This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room.  Here's one at 9:04 pm.  It says:  From Debi.  Please call me at home.
Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.
Jeremy would have never killed himself.
Alright, c'mon Peter.  We're moving you to a cell.
You opened with the English.  Lutz won't use it.  He opened his first game with it.
No.
Bainbridge Books.
What are they, please?
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
When I was very young.
It seems like such a complicated game.
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
They couldn't break the riddle.
I can't right now.  I've got a game.
You mean like in the steam room?
You're not?
Relax.
I know it was bad.
No.
You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.
No.  You were talking about chess.
What is this?
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
You've got to face the things you feel.
I tried again and got through.
What's wrong?
The other night -- I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have.  I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did.
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
If we could just figure out what the next word is going to be.  He said the game's going to end tonight so there's only going to be one more word.
It's over now.
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
Thank you, but I can wait.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
Have they harmed you?
You must move away from the Center.
That's a better one.
You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.
You have rope?
I am too old to climb down a rope.
He has come for Lyssa.
Can she be forced?
No. She must agree of her own free will.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
You will tell me her name and we will go together.
You're coming with us.
Do not let the waters touch you.
Even by you?
I cannot take comfort when she has none.
Once is enough, thank you.
Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato that's dying.
Fame.
They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.
To the place where Death lives.
We must try to get horses.
What kind of friend do you think I am?
Go. I command you.
Where are you going?
We'll meet you at the inn.
I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision.
Put me down, you lout!
You had better manners as a pig.
Oh, my poor stew!
He is the King.
It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
Knowledge I wouldn't want.
Her name is Death.
Who speaks that name!
But you would not stay with me.
We had no children.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
You will come with me.
He forgot his money...  My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
No.
How can you say it?
Who'll I aim at?
The yellow and pink.
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
When I say I love you.
What shall we do?
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
No! I don't want to leave you!!
I'm sick with practicing, that's it...
Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
Can I sit on the stairways now?
But... He works for your same employer?
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you.  Norman smiles.
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
Here comes the resume.
It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
What?
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
What steps do we take now?
What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
So what's the deal Maurice?
I know what you're getting at.
It's a special day isn't it?
Ellen?
... Love is shown through actions not just words.
There's no reason.
I do love you... very, very much.
... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.  I don't want us to be that way Ellen.
Your father?
To where?
That's a reasonable assumption.
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
I thought you were asleep.
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
Perhaps there's another route?
To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.
Walking where?
Don't do this.
In a hospital.
What do your friends call you?
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
... My father.
I don't have kids.
Hello, Mr. Parker.
Hello.
Confused.  I'm not sure what to do now.  I'm not sure what he wants for me.
He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.
Evening News?
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
What do you think I should get?
Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
To death?
Are you serious.
Yes.
First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
How long have I been here?
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
I know that...
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
Thank you, Sera.
Maybe I should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what it's like to sleep with you.
How'd this happen?
How much, do you think?
Don't hit me.
Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced "History of Lycra". What are your backups?
I can't tell you.
Is he always such an ass?
That's not what's important.
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
Did you hear a shot fired?
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
What are you talking about?
-- his life?
I don't know.
What'd you do?
Is she?
You ready?
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
How'd it go at the trial?
I know. He has it sent out.
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
We still love you. Sisters forever!
Once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll want me back. It's a completely brilliant plan!
Oh, how sweet! You made friends with a nerdy girl.
And make sure you read the footnotes in Levinson's class. That's where all her exam questions come from.
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
Why?
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
But I'm not positive it's gonna happen tonight --
I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
How could this happen?
You don't really believe she's innocent?
There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
I completely agree.
C'mon. Let me take you home.
Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches?
I didn't mean --
Well, yeah, but --
You look -- nice.
Thanks for the backup.
It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.
Yes.
Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas. Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house.
Fool's magic.
My generosity is not so large as that.
We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
Kill me... I want... so nice...
We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
I see...
You're a beast!
From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly.
Baron Couer de Noir is a blight 'gainst all nature.  We dwarves be not fighters; still we are with you in this battle.  Some of our handiwork may be of assistance.
Gump, is it?
No!  Tis not the time!  I want no part of your frolic.
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --
Big question that, lad.  Why what?
Don't you know?
That much magic I can offer ye, a small measure of entertainment at best.  Making the world a frozen hell is beyond me modest powers.
How is it this hag knows the truth?
There it be, lad.  The Lindfarne Mound.  Kings long forgotten lie there, lost in their final sleep.
There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
By the grace of God.
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
Beware.
This is ogre's magic.
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
Something the matter?
I should hope not!
Is she... dead?
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
There aren't enough arrows.
What magic have we on our side?
The wound is mortal.
The kitchen be the most important room in a palace, for if the victuals ain't right, little else is likely to be so.
Sunlight.
Will you explain what's going on?
Hey!  Stop it!  I can't see.
Can't we move any faster?
Never show mercy!
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
I'll try.
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
These for me?
I may have said perhaps...
Let's rest a minute.  I'm so thirsty.
Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
They rival the angels of paradise.
He'll not flee if I show myself?
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
Tis the truth.
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
I'm afraid it may storm.
Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
No!  I won't let it happen...
But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
Lili... I love you!
Biting you?
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
Honored to make your acquaintance.
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
How do I get the horn back?
Where do I find the Baron's castle?
Ask away, sweet man.
Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you.
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
I'd be honored.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
You... you... you mortal you!
And as barren of love as stone.
What care the bones when the soul is free?
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
Can you show us the way?
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up.  Huh, Mom?
He's not there.
He's here.  Check the bathroom.
When does George get to come see his house?
Oh.
What color?
And why was the alarm on?
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
You'd better call and cancel.
He seems lonely.
Are you his friend?
My keys.
Where to?
Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?
Why are you so stupid?
What are you talking about?
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
It could have been a squirt gun.
Bob Larson.  Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen?
An exhaust system or a window is code.
He buys and sells the world.
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
This isn't me.  We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer.  But you won't change.
I'm not.
Oh.
I hate this job.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work.  I could maybe ask them if you could choose one.  But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours.  They're a part of this firm.  They inspire me.  I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed.  It amazes me. I would miss that too much.  Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.
Sam?
Thanks for the shower.
The whole summer, man.  Party in Tahoe.
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
You'll know me by the time we're through.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
I hate turkey.
Why?
No one would blame me if I left!
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
Where are you going?
Did you got through my pants?
What I'm not.
What are you now?
I'm telling you now.
To hide a black eye.
After everything he did to you and your mom?
I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
Do you remember?
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
Do you need anything?  I'll go to the pharmacy.  I have some Demerol at home.
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
I need to know.
Is your back still killing you?
Back.  Neck.  Back.
Been thinking?
He already knows everything about what he can't do.  You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.
Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
Sam took them to a movie.
You could keep it and rent it out?
Go tell your father we're eating.
Dad's home, already?
Is Mae Rose okay?
What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
Sure, boss.
I don't see no wedding ring, Banks. Conjugal visits are for married prisoners only.
As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss.
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.
Sure I do. What's your name again?
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
Start your job? What kind of job?
I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
That's right, a loan officer.
Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
Reward?
What a second, you've been in here since you were thirteen?
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
So?
You know what I'm saying.
I'm not gonna forget it. What does that mean? If you've got a plan, I think I have a right to know about it. I told you my plan.
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
No.
Don't mention it.
What am I gonna eat?
What about us? Don't forget to mention us.
Crop duster.
That's the way it is.
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
You sure it was him?
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
Over to the morgue and up the hill to the cemetery. Never thought I'd admit it, Claude, but you were right.
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
No, this ain't gonna work either. It's half chocolate, half vanilla.
I know you're not talking to me...
How about some steak sauce?
We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.
Where am I at, man?
What do you think about that?
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
Are you offering me a bribe?
Jenny?
Me? Willie Long.
Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
Blacks welcome there?
You shouldn't have come here.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
Little Nicky.
That's what I thought!
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
...their damned souls will be ours.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
All these good people have totally been led astray.
My mom wasn't a goat?
Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
Makin' friends already.
This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
Release the evil?
This is baloney!
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
Everything's fine, pop.
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
I mean... tough break.
Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.
That's a pretty brassiere.
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off.
Did you check out the dragon mouth?
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
Why are you laughing?
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
"Octopus people?"
Valerie?
That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
Nicky!
No.
It looks like the work of a brother...
A black guy?
Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
What the hell took you so long?
Where do you live, Mary?
Here.
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
And?
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
You could have called me yourself.
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
Maybe... sure...
I'm going to run.
About running, dying what?
I don't have much time.
Uh-uh.
They won't believe us.
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
They won't listen.
Will you take me with you?
I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?
I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
What does it mean?
I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
Are you sure?
Goodbye.
Hello, Sandman.
It's all right with me. Is he here?
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
What kind of place is this?
How did you get here?
No, no, no
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?
I like to remember things my own way.
How would you like to take me to dinner?
I don't know.
I want more.
Hi.
We should stop seeing each other.
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
Pete... Don't...
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else...  To a girlfriend's house.  But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
Where's the bathroom?
Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  We can go anywhere.
Never saw him before in my life.
We saw you that night, Pete.
Did you ask him who he is?
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
One of the guards must have leaked it.
I wouldn't know how.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
Something wrong?
What's bothering you, Madison?
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
I like to laugh, Fred.
That's why I married you.
What's that?
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
What night?
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
I had a dream about you last night...
We've got to call the police.
We will.
Let's go home.
Was there?
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
I don't remember... What happened that night?
Where'd you come from?
Conway's gone again! Run out! Listen to this! From Gainsford.
What about those men we met this morning?
Two years!?
I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
Yes, it just shows—  I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?
Good morning, Lovey.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.
No kidding?
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
Okay, Lovey.
Come on, Lovey.
Charming chap.
It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
That's what I say. What do you say to a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards in the other room.
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
Cave, eh? Where?
Hey - look!
There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
That's intelligent.
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
Yes, charming.
I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
Now, what would you like to do?
Oh, immediately.
It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
Just what I needed too.
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?
What are you talking about?
I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates?  I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
What's she got to do with it?
No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened.
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
Was this your idea?
A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
I'm so glad.
Ouch!
Why?
Why, mother?
I've thought about it for years.  I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave.  Am I forgiven for sending for you?
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
Hesitated, sir.
Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?
They don't?
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space.  Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.
So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
Something seem unusual to you about that?
Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
And what's this ... ?
You think that's what's-happening?
Jesus...
Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
Since how long?
It's marble.
Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...
Or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare.  I really like that.  Let the other girls have the guys like you. Chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples.  I find you all so boring.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
Yeah ... ?
The kid looked desperate.  I figured...
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Oh yeah?  Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to?  You know how many rules you've just broken?
Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?
Found it.
This it?
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
They're gone.
They went right to the President.
Please --
Where are we going?
Someplace safe.
Why?
Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
The nano... what?
I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then, or you'll --
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
Hence the expression...
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
Huh, we don't seem to have her data.
Yes, sir.
Lara called me.
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
Don't run, Chief.  You know we'll catch you.  You trained us.
Somewhere near the capital?
Did he close the front door?
Red Ball?
As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
They're not in any pain.  We keep their heads pretty well stocked with dopamine and endorphins. Plus, we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels -- don't want 'em to drift off to sleep, but they can't be kept too awake either.
Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
Just go to the beginning!
The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
Kill me!
The what?
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
You want to bring it down.
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
He's dead, Lara.
Oh, God, what did you do?
I haven't worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
I thought you were retiring?
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
It's the same prevision.
Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
So there is a way to fool the system?
There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
Cream and sugar.
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
So you haven't seen his apartment?
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
What was it then?
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
I haven't seen him in two years.
Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up.
Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben.
No thank you.
We have snifters
...And here is the key to the mini- bar. Room and tax has been picked up by Cardiff Giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals.
Are you sure?
Yeah. Take it.
So?
No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
Manhattan.
What the fuck was that about?
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
It's a poison arrow tree frog.
I don't know.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
Yeah? You sure?
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
I said no touching.
Your dance is over.
What's your record at?
Yeah, sure.
You driving her?
What's his name?
So, when's the drop.
Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?
Pshhh...
I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm --
I know.
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...
That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
Don't be shitty.
I'll page you with the number.
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
I like it.
Nice work.
Maybe we should call for a cab.
Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van.
You sold it? I thought they stole it.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
Missing what? He didn't say shit.
What did I 'get?'
I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
What's up?
Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
What do you have left?
Eighty.
Eighty five.
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
Three and a half hours?
Where do you get this shit?
Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.
No. I'll wait here.
Hey, boys.
Kinda. Yeah.
Where do you live?
Don't drag my ass into this --
You really in trouble?
So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
I'm half Irish.
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
A little Charlie, perhaps.
Here they are, then.
Come, now. You just got here.
Good morning.
Is it nice?
The Soho Grand?
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
Tell me.
Don't worry. I get it.
Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif.
She poured it for --
And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?
Edinburgh.
Dip?
Red, and I ain't no punk.
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.
Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.
I don't want your money.
Let Billie finish.
Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
What for?
Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.
Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.
I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
I don't know how.
You are now Benjamin 2X.
Could we sit down someplace?
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
Talk about what?
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
Just what is your question?
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
"His greatest greatness."
Say what you're saying.
And like a fool I believe it.
She know?
Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.
The sentences to run concurrently.
I better not come in.
I ain't stupid.
Get out.
500.
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie?
You the man.
Bang, bang. You're dead.
I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best preacher hype I ever did hear.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
You want to be the head man?
That's right.
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.
I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle.
It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
[How does it work?]
[The boss did or his brother.]
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!]
[It's non-negotiable.]
[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
Creasy?
Yes or no?
How do you think he got out?
You feel sorry for the husband?
You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself.
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
Be a swimmer.
I'm fine.
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
It's Creasy.
Where are you?
I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
For an American she understands this country very well.
You should be sleeping, baby.
My wife, Mr. Creasy.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
It will be a hard break.
[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
[Who's that?]
You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
What was she to Creasy then?
I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl...
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
I told you she wasn't attractive...
Oh, yeah.
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
Yeah, sure.
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you.
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own.
Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
Marty, your mother wants you onna phone.
We gotta postcard from my son Nickie and his bride. They're inna big hotel in Florida on their honeymoon. Everything is very nice.
I don't think I remember him.
What they say?
These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
Please...
I'd like that very much.
What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara...  Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him.
Siddown, siddown. You want some chicken? We got some chicken in the ice box.
No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.
You say something?
Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice.
All right, I'll see you, Thomas, because he wants an answer by Monday.
Hello, Marty, when you coming home? Where you now? Because your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia, they're here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine... I don't know...
Put on your blue suit...
Did you offer the young lady some fruit?
I said, is she Italian girl?
You want a beer, Ang'?
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
That's swell, Missus Fusari.
Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, Aunt Theresa.
That's all right, that's all right...
Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa...
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it.  I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night.  Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?
Wadda you so sore about?
Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?
Hospital.
Well, he's taken care of. Scratch one hot dog.
I don't believe it's right for you to involve a boy who's not seventeen years old yet...
Make it yourself, or is it real?
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
The chest-cutter.
This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.
And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
Don't try to get it far down. Kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son-ofa-bitch.
Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.
Henry's got our orders! We're going home!
There's no transportation anyway this time of night.
It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
Pierce! That soldier requires immediate attention. I'm a surgeon and I know.
I though you said we didn't have a drop.
What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
...But I turned in my knee pads.
It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.
Christ, it's Ho-Jon!
I don't get it.
It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.
I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
Something else we have in common.
It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
Ayuh.
You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
Of course not.
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.
If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?
But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?
Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
Yes, that's what I mean.
Stop that, O'Rielly!
Oh, get out of here!
Morning, Radar. How were things?
Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of them, I'm afraid.
Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
As long as there's a pile-up, we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest.
Er, would you, er, would you like to make some money?
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think—
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
Look, John—what we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a—
Thirty dollars.
And, Miss Mitchell—I think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
Oh!
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
The Websters.
What?
That's your father's diary, Ann.
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
No. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day.
That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!
The letter from John Doe.
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius— Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doe—and he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
I can read. I can read!
Oh.
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads are being pulled—the Governor's starting a libel suit—what's more, they all know John Doe's a phoney—and they insist on seeing him.
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
Oh, let me go, will you!
Go out and find her!
Yeah, Boss?
Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe!
I've seen guys like you go under before. Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. The first thing that happens to a guy—
Grubbel's here. See? 
You don't have to—Why, we're with you, Mr. Doe. We just lost our heads and acted like a mob. Why, we . . .
That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
Hello, Mr. Connell.
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
I think maybe you'd better. And Connell—I'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and—
Miss Mitchell, do me a favor, will you? Go on out and get married and have a lot o' babies—but stay out o' newspaper business!
No.
That's a lie!
Yes! I was paid! But the—
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention later.
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
I know one way you can do it.
Is there a crowd in the street?
SWAT wants to go in.
Dinner's on you.
Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off.
God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
I won't get away with it.
Automatic.
You signed out twice.
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
Open your shirt.
I've rarely shot anyone.
What's the point of this?
Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
Where did you hear that?
I think I can handle that one.
You think you can learn, McCall?
So what do I say to this guy?
Get good at it.
Yes.
What did you see?
I'm just practicing my lying.
How long you been coming here?
You're crazy.
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
And what about the ones you don't save?
So what do you want to do?
Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
I'm not drunk. Yet.
What do you want from me?
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
Yeah that's it.
Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
You like this place?
Stay here, don't move.
Roper.
Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.
What do you think would be in order?
I'll provide you with transportation.
Who's running it!
Are these yours?
Yeah, they are but...
I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
There are two million people in there with you.
No, not me, I've been lucky.  But I've seen what happens to other people --
What's happening?
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
Halden sent men to kill me in my sleep, but simple illusions won out.  So he now sends the legend to finish the deed.
Until you're on the net where the corporation can't touch you, you can't open the system.  They'll eject it if you do.
Try harder.
What did he tell you?
We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember.
Where?
Then how do you know about --
But I don't know anything about programming.
Not you.  A copy.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
It's passing over earth as we speak!  Trajectory coordinates are 009843.
It's far too dangerous.  Zordon would never allow it.
Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here!
You okay?
Of course!  The power is of another world.  Another dimension.
I'm in!
Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.
I ain't no fuckin' kike!
And I ain't no nigger either!
What you're sayin' makes a lotta sense. Ya know, if I keep on killin' people like I have, I won't have no more friends left!
Maybe you better hear what I got to say first.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
From your mouth ta God's ear.
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
A hundred-seven bucks too much. Any kid who drops an extra dime is gonna be talkin' to Moliari.
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side.
We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
Inside, they were talking of you.
Something came up.
A lot of shit came out of me in the hospital. I'm sorry you got hit by it.
I'll talk to Nucky. Get you set up like the fuckin' Prince of Wales.
And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.
You bastards, I said twenty!
Who?
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
I'm glad ya come.
What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
Every successor will owe his loyalty to us. Together we take out Maranzano, and each family gets a piece of his operation.
Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
And how many soldiers do you have?
I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
They do what I tell 'em.
We must be friends, Charlie.
Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
Shuddup.
Sorry, Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight.
What a cozy little scene.
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
You're fuckin' crazy.
Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
At the moment, yes.
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
Why?
Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.
Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?
Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.
You're acting kind of...odd.
You sure this is...medically advisable?
How was it? I don't recall.
I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
The ring...
Kimmy! What's the matter?
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
Stu...Stu...
It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
We like to think so, yeah.
I'm good.
Behind the books.
He seemed quite taken with you.
Mother, I ...
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
Mm hmm.
Who is it?
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
I'm from South Dakota.  Where are you from?
This way?
Forty-five all total.
I did not--
Looks like it, but--
Sure. Sure. I'll hang a light in the steeple. One if by land--two if by sea!... Okay!  Diz--you won't believe it. Daniel Boone's *lost*!
How do you *like* this! You don't suppose that ranger met up with some kids--and took 'em for a hike!
Eight to five Little Boy Blue is plastered.
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
Oh--that again. Yeah.
You play--left field.
I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
I'll cherish ya.
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
Where?
Susan? Nah!
Hey! We're gettin' married--!
Well--let's dig up the preacher, kid.
I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!
Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*--
All I know is--he said to me tonight-- "What does your wife think?" My wife. Thinks we're married--
The war's on!
Diz!
I knew it! I knew a night's rest wasn't possible in this house!  Hubert!
Yes, yes--phone, phone--  A--an outrage, pet--an outrage--I'll look into this--  Hello--Joe!--What!--No! Not really! Terrible!
Taylor, my dear.
This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
Henry Hill.
I--I couldn't, Jim. Those men were--
--a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate!
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
Than what?
All right, Senator--let's get these bags and the livestock together--
For a question!
Will the Senator yield for a question?
Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?
Ah, now, that's better.
No, Jeff--please--!
Good evening, sir. I was just making some--  Governor Hopper!
Hello, Jefferson.
Certainly would, Joseph.
Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
Most natural thing in the world!
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
No, gee--I couldn't stay here--
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
No!
I've got more. You better tell me.
You win. It's--Clarissa.
You--don't know it, do you?
Already? All these letters?
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?
The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish!
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*! 
A camp! Well!
Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
That's--that's splendid.
Well! You don't say!
The chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith.
Uh--Mr. President--you and I are about to be alone in here, sir. I'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this.  Mr. President--I call the chair's attention to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate Section Three. "If it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators present--," and that begins to look like me--"may direct the Sergeant-at-arms to request, and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent Senators."  Mr. President--*I so direct*.
Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
No?
Look, Senator--I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is. What do you need me for? Get somebody else--get a registered nurse--
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
Well, what do you want me to do? Stand around like you chump and let that drooling infant wrap that Willet Creek Dam appropriation around my neck. Either he falls in line with us and behaves himself or I'll break him so wide open they'll never be able to find the pieces.
You won't stand for it?
Jim, you don't have to--
Jeff--this is Mr. Taylor.
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
Will the Senator yield?
I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me?
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.
He's still pixilated.
Yes, sir.
No.
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
Yes, but I—
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
You fainted.
There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.
It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
Sure. I met you.
I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
Huh?
Oh, that—
I've often thought about going back.
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
Ready?
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
People have been crucified before.
You're a fool, Babe.
What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this.
Had the boys follow us.
Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
Sure.
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
Gold, eh?
Fourteen carat?
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
Let me go! I wanna see him!
We'll send for the police!
Relatives of old man Semple.
That's pretty.
I guess we'd better try somebody else.
Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]
That's funny. Why is that?
Oh.
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
Oh, they insisted on following me.
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
Why, it's an artistic institution—
We provide opera.
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
Here's the order for the plows. We got a good price on them.
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
Huh?
Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
Uh-huh.
That's all right. I got it off my chest.
Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life!  A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
That ought to be fun.
Christian Svenson.
Yes, ma'am.
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
What do you think you're doing?
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.
Who?
Why, that's an echo, sir!
Why are they ganging up against me?
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
One hundred books?
It's happened before.  I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it.  I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?
Doubtful. What did he say?
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...
I see.
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
What's that?
Why? I'm paying for this.
Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...  ...I really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, I can't thank you enough for...
I feel like we're making real progress here.
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
Tastes good.
I do.
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret?
Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so.  Nice car. How's that place?
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
It's a country club. Don't worry about it.
But you know how to drive?
Hiya, Doc.
Martin.
What do you mean?
I think you know what I mean.
Feel free to lie down. Most people do.
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
We don't discuss it.
Something's bothering her.
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
So whose route is this?
In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
That's what I like.
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in?
Hello?
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
But...
What?
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
A doll?
Just you.
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
You were messed up, man.
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
When?
It's possible. I don't know about that.
Altar boys?
You never were any good with the ladies, O'Connell.
Let's make us even, shall we?
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
What is he doing here?
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!
You bastards!
Fifty percent.
No, I mean --
-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
What are those mirrors for?
There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?
You don't believe in curses, huh?
Why would I do that?
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
Got it!
Yes?
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?
I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
That thing gives me the creeps.
You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
What?
We gotta get her back.
And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
Your mind is so slippery.
Where are you going?
Much less go outside.
Atta, girl!
I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law.
It's late. I'm headin' home.
No one will believe us.
Snap out of it!
That boy's got talent.
You're nuts.
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for.
Sure -- I guess.
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
I just want to be a superhero.
Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview --
What are you talking about?
This place is built like a fortress.
But she still might call!
Are you coming or not?
Are you famous?
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
Wow.
I use it... to fight evil.
You did?
This is bad.
To us!
He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
Ah, yes -- proceed.
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
Proceed.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back.  When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down.
Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "Berthier sees only what is in the open," Murat said.  "But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest."  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment.
Cavalry?
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
The numbers are not particularly relevant.  You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.
Well, Belliard, what's this?  What are you doing here?  Where is the enemy?
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
Bertrand, sire.
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
Why didn't you wake me then?
Impossible, I don't believe it.
But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
What is that?
Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.
I am, Citizen.  Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais?
This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.
And he sent you to me?
You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.
You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?
I know of no better time.
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
Ah, that is good.
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
Yes!!
I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
What are you talking about?
I wrote it.
What?
You wrote it.
And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?
Now, the section headed "Secret Clauses of the Treaty" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade.
What I am talking about is moderation.
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769.  He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion.  In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena.
That's it?
Great moves, Day-Day.
Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.
Sorry, bro, reflexes.  How did you do that?
Fuck, what's his name?
Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin.  They're right there in the back.
This you?
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
What's the matter?
You make it sound so easy.
That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
Hello, remember me?
What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
What is it?
Excuse me?
Nice to meet you?
I can't give you your damn money back on this.
I do.
Why did he go in the house?
Money?  Man, we came over here from some sugar and rolling papers.  We was going to get high, and I was going to show this white boy how to make Kool-Aid.  That's all.
20 minutes?
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
Huh?
Hey, what's going on?
Are you going to take me to see Mom?
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
What's the matter?
Craig, I want you to meet my old lady, Suga.  Suga, this is Craig.
Mr. Nasty time?
I threw my back, again.
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
All right, I'll do it.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
Amtrack?
Huh?
My security people are right next door.
Who did?
Good luck.
The gun...
What would you do in my place?
How am I supposed to get away?
Let me talk to her again.
I want'to talk to her.
Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant.
I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?
What do you do, if I may be so bold?
You got anything smaller?
What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
Cover your mouth.
My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them.
Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
Meet Irene.
You said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing.
You're going to go see her.
Well?
Goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come here!
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
Why?
Look at 'em. He'd do anything for her.-
Foreigners! Fuck!
Put her on.
No.
You killed two men, Ben Harper.
Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold!
The religion the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us.
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore. Now he sets in his old wharf-boat...
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
And when little King Jesus' Ma and Pa heard about that plan, what do you reckon they went and done?
Where's Ruby?
Yes! Yes!
And the Lord told that man --
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
About what!
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
He lied!
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage.  You-all have your work cut out!
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
John, when your Dad says 'come', you should mind him.
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
Yes?
What's your name?
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
Only she won't never let me play with it.
Yes; from the first night.
My flesh and blood!
How can you tell?
Guess I did.
No.
They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
Much better.
I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?!
She dreamed this would happen...
-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
She lived there.
Get outside and watch her house. If you see anything funny call me.
How you know that?
Mother, for petesakes.
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
I must be going nuts...
It's real, Mamma. Feel it.
Screw sleep!
Feeling better?
And then what happened?
I can't believe his mother let him come over here.
No more fights.
When did you have a nightmare?
Well, here are fifty francs.
Aren't you late?
What are you serving?
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was. Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause.
A dress you wear in the evening.
What do you wear in the morning?
Are we free, Buljanoff?
Capitalistic methods...
We don't like Razinin.
What is it?
I am Comrade Buljanoff.
Which lawyer?
Now let's forget everything except that we're together.
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
Guest?
Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
Good evening, Gaston.
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
Good evening, Your Highness.
It's a real Paris reunion.
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
Get out of here!
A week?
You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
We did our best, Comrade.
No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
So that is your house?
Is this what you call the "butler"?
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
Don't do it, please.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
I can't possibly think of a better reason.
I must go.
Let's forget that we ever met.
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
What?
Yes.
It's nine o'clock.
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
Go on.
But, darling, you can't do that.
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.
And we won't stretch up our arms...
...and we won't clench our fist...
I am so happy. No one can be so happy without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished.  I want to confess, darling.
I know... it's the Russian soul.
No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
No music.
Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can look.
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?
Hello, Leon!
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!
Now, Swana...
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Oh, yes.
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.
No thanks, Swana.
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.
It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
Good morning, Comrade.
You want me to go to Constantinople?
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ...
Mr. President, I don't know what to say.  As soon as we learned from the Secret Service you were en route, the Director was notified.  He should be here any minute.
Frankly, sir, it stinks.  I have no access.  I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff.
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
Let's not forget they're just kids, they don't vote.
You do it.
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
Mitchell?
No, sir.
I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
He's begging for a meeting, chief.  He wants to go overseas for awhile.
I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
What about England?
Who the fuck does Cox think he is?  I never made a dime from public office!  I'm honest.  My dad died broke.  You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ...
About a dozen.
Cox!  Fire him.
Sir, the deadline is today.
If you resign, you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years.
Lincoln used it.
That was civil war.
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ...
They did what?!  I don't understand. Why'd they go into O'Brien's office in the first place?
Their fourth!
Bob, did I approve the Ellsberg thing? You know, I'm glad we tape all these conversations because ... I never approved that break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist.  Or maybe I approved it after the fact?  Someday we've got to start transcribing the tapes.
You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
The Bay of Pigs? ... That was Kennedy's screw-up.  How does that threaten us?
He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
How is this national security?
This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob.  We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own.  Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.
He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.
Mr. President!
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
What about happiness, Mother?
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.
What?
... little Bobby.
There must be a quarter-million out there, Edgar.  They've been at it now for a year.  Young kids just like Tricia.  I don't know.  Do you think they have a point, Edgar?  Maybe this whole damned system of government is ...
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?
The White House.
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians.  And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam.  These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ...
Gentlemen, I tried.  I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.  He heard me and he made his decision.  I appreciate your sentiments.  I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots, but it's nothing I can do anything about.  Now, it's a long drive back to Dallas tonight, and Trini and I have got an early flight tomorrow to New York ...
He was, he was.  We taught a class together at Harvard.  But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ...
This will get me a second term.  Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. There's no history.  I, Nixon, was born to do this.
That doesn't matter now, Henry.  The point is, you might lose some of your media-darling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry.
Don't be stupid.  The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways.  You're the only friend I've got, Henry.
You have many friends ... and admirers ...
Yes, Mr. President.
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.
Uh, wait ...
You all right?
They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
Get off that.  That leads nowhere. You should offer condolences to the families of those kids.
Where you from?
... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ...
We got the press this time!
But what am I telling the press about Kent State?
Of them.
I'll concede in the morning.
What are you saying?  What are you talking about?
This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it?  They want to drive us apart.  To beat us.  We can't let them do it.  We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together.
Dick, you should call Bobby.
Buddy? ...
Do you really want this, Dick?
Then I'll be there for you.
Are you okay?
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
No, I don't.  I'm not Jack ...
When?
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
Hiding what?
You can't expect me to explain that to you.
You don't expect me to believe that for one minute, do you?  Does it matter what's on them? Really? ... Murder, Dick?  Sex?  Your secrets, your fantasies?  Or just me and you and ...
To what?
Hey, you know Henry Kissinger -- he's down from Harvard.  On my staff, foreign policy whiz ...
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
Want a cup?
You're discouraged.
No money in his room there?
It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs.  It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean? What is it leading to?
Well what would you call him.
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
He won't neither. He never has.
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
The old boy shot by the highway?
The Rangers and DEA are heading out to the desert this morning. You gonna join 'em?
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
I never do.
Maybe I'll go ridin.
I can't plan your day.
To your husband.
It's full a money.
...Where'd you get the pistol?
Why would we go to Odessa?
Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
Hey.
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
She'll be all right.
Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?
Did you go up to his trailer?
Yes I did.
Where does he work?
Hello?
...Where's the transponder?
Yeah, that'll suck some power. Over time.
Why would I care where you're going.
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
Yes, I do. I think you do too. So this is what I'll offer. You bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable. The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't.
How much?
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
Will there be anything else?
You already asked me that.
Well... I need to close now --
You married into it.
Call it?
The kind with the most poles.
Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms.
How well do you know Chigurh.
...You pick the option with the applicable rate.
Could I get another room.
You want to change rooms?
That's me.
Then you'll like me.
...But that won't last.
Not that way.
What did you do?
Were you in Nam?
The heroin. You don't have it.
No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.
How is she?
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the record yet.
I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
It wasn't a woman.
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
I questioned Joyce about all this...
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
Do you know who I am?
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...
Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
Umm... yes. Back home.
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
Maroon.  I stole it.
What?
Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
You never gave us a chance...
I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.
Of course.
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
Thanks...
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
I came for love...
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage --
I left my husband two days ago.
No. Loma Vista.
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
You made out alright.
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
How many men have I talked to?
Why'd you help me in the first place?
He is real.
Rosa...
You should have a little faith in people.
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
Blake, I can handle that transplant!
More than you know. Is there anything else?
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
Hold still, Del, we're just talking here...  Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off.
I didn't. You gave me a look!
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
What the hell was that, another statement?
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too.  Very, very impressive...
Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career, do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional!  AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY!
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
It's a very moving experience, trust me.
No.
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time!
It just didn't fit her profile...
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.
Very graceful. Perfect form.
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
Oh, five years, give or take.
Really?
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
Hmm?
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
David Ravell.
You lie, motherfucker...
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
Mr. Campbell?
I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
Visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns down at the Indianola Savings and Loan and slap that cash down on the barrelhead and buy back the family farm. Hell, you ain't no kind of man if you ain't got land.
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
How'd he know about the treasure?
Gopher, Everett?
Pete have a brother?
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs.
I'm sayin' we har this man away.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Not out the other side his face, though.
...Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.
That's good, honey.
That's not my ring.
Not your...
Uh-huh.
To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.
A million dollars.
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
It's awful white of ya to take it like that, Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts.
Hold on there - I don't want this pomade, I want Dapper Dan.
Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!
It's bona fide!
Come back here, kid!
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
I wrote. Not every week...
I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe?
I want to fly, sir!
Yes, sir!
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here.
You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
Yes, sir!
You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
He was. He died.
...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side.  So how late are you, Lynette?
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
You serious about having him over?
No. I never feel like that.
God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?
What did you tell him about the baby?
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
Seriously.
Do you go to school?
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.
Be a friend. Leave.
Paula, I never try to fool anybody about who I am, what I want... so if even in the back of your --
That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
Sure.  Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
So?
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
How do you figure that's your bunk?
He said he grew up poor?
Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
Sid, what happened?
I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
Me.  I am.
Fuck!
Keep your voice down.
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
Pure idiot.
She said she did.
Be quiet.
She's never coming out.
I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.
The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
Nobody leaves.
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
Makes me nervous.
No, Edgar Allen.
Well, I know that now.
What do they want?
Wait.
Yeah.
Chills?
"Get the fuck out of my house."
What am I, a five year old?
Morse code?
Do it.
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
Huh uh.
Alma!? I uhh I don't think...
This brothers is gonna be a colossal event. We'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras.  Will you cool it? What's up man? What it be Bobby?
Hold up a second... We got a decision to make.
Dig it, you know those brothers over in San Fran... call themselves the Black Panthers too?
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and you don't tell me. Remember you're working for us.
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother where you been?
The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse." Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white.
Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
You mean...
Yeah.
Whatever you need, I'll be there.
What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, Sister Betty's safe. This was a good day...
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is?
Nothing.
You alright?
Motherfuckers...
My Mom's at that.
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Do you think Francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy?
Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?
Am I one of that sort?
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
You couldn't have known.
Of course, I do.
Goodbye, Charlotte.
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
Thank you.
Prisoner exchange.
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
How can we end this madness?
Civility is a secondary virtue.  It is superseded by duty.
Father, a post rider came from Charleston.  You have a letter inside.
Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
And the Governor?
Do you intend to enlist without my permission?
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.
Father...
Is it?
Stay the course... your mother used to say that to me when I'd get drunk or lose my temper.
She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
Please.
Damn it, Francis!  How in God's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war?
Name five hundred.
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars.
I was sorry to hear about your son.
If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait.  He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that.
Seventeen.
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy!
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
Nice.
No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?
Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?
What say, Louis?
We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
You keep saying that.
Whose burying ground?
No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?
It's Ellie's cat.
The movers--
She's finally asleep.
You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face.
I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
Enough of that!  Name your terms.
It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime.  No good can come of it.
You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.
That so?
So what now, Jack Sparrow?  Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?
Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
Boy overboard!
On his heels!  Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort!  Elizabeth, are you --
No.  The pirates have taken Will --
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
That would hardly be proper.
Ceremony?
Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?
You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord.  We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again.  And we've got rum, praise the Lord.  We can stay alive a month, maybe more.  Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.
What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!
Why?
These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
First -- have you found me a crew?
Say again?
What?  He never told me that.
Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?  You two weren't invited?
That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
What's your name?
Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
Come aboard.
That's not true.
Shut up, before you lose them all!
But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--
Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship.  I'll keep 'em busy.
No, it's not.
You've seen it?
Yes.
... no.
Commodore --
Speak.
The body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air, there has been nothing sacred about nature. Nature is the enemy, Mr. O'Brien, and science is our greatest weapon against her.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration.
Poppy, please --
That might work.
They're here!  They're here!  We have the nanobot.
What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab.
I'm a scientist.  I have lived my whole life by the diagnostic application of fact and the fact is, Argon is going to get whatever he wants, so if I were you, I'd give it to him.
You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
Sir, please try to hold still.
Same old Daniel.
I remember you said, nanotechnology was going to change the world.
It already is.
Yeah.
And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think.  It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole.  It's really wonderful.
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
We've had this conversation already, Daniel.
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up!  If you're gonna flip your wig --
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
What happened to it?
Daniel!
We don't have time for hysterics.
The replicators start off like assemblers, but the replicators never stabilize.
Susan!
Just look at it!
This is what I deserve for trying to protect the world from a madman and his mercenary physicists?
And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
What did you want my hair for?
I think it would be better for me to go alone.  I'm sure Sim is looking for you.  Just sit tight.  I'll bring you back a pizza.
You saved my life.
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
That's impossible.
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
Well, what else do you expect them to call you?
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.
May I use your telephone?
Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.
Will you step into the library?
For what?
Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
Your place?
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now—
Gallagher!
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
No? What do you look upon her as?
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I—
You're acting like a child.
Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
Ah-ah-ah!
Fine newspaper the Tribune.
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
Give my regards to your managing editor.
Impossible. Put it on again.
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
How do you like your bath, sir?
You're my what?
Did you take anything out of those pants?
All right, outside!
That's a canary, sir.
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
My error.
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
No.
Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?
I suppose you know why I came—?
Surely, come right in.
I don't eat waffles.
Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut.
Yes.
I beg your pardon?
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
What's going on here? Who is this woman?
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
No, sir!
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
I just putter.
How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
It isn't done, gentlemen! It isn't done, I say! It isn't done!
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
I've got to go ...
Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  That's IF she can learn to bake.
I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
Oh yeah.
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
But where would we go?
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
I don't believe it.
Want some bridge mix?
And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
Rain.
Do you know that it's illegal?
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
Hello Bud.
Green.
Pleasantville Marathon?
Oh my God.
Noooooo!
Owns the hardware store.
Can we do any better?
No way.
You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
I just don't think we have the right to ...
Yeah ...
How come I'm still in black and white?
Right here.
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
Keeps going ...
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
How?
Yeah.
I picked them myself. They grow wild up here.  Mmm. So sweet.
What's going on?
Where are they?
Because we don't belong!
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
WAIT A MINUTE!!
Hello there.
... Hi.
Because you're coming home.
Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
Yeah ...
I'm so glad you're here.
Do you have the lettuce?
Have you cooked the burgers?
Yeah ...
Forget about that!
Really?
It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
And what was this?
What city?
What's the listing?
Yeah, but please don't do that.
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question:
What?
I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
It's not mine.
Goodbye.
Hey. What are you doing?
Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
No she didn't; that's a lie.
This is Georgia.
Yeah? So what are you doing, then?
No.
You have a girlfriend?
I'm horny, Jack, what about you?
Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
Uh-huh.
I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
No. I'm sorry.
There's a piano in the street.
It's fine. It was fun, though.
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
Yeah.
....yeah....
What happened?
Your portable reed organ....the piano.
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
Ok.
Have a good trip.
Do you wanna have sex?
It's ok to ask that.
Ok.
Yeah.
No.
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
......and this is confidential?
...3407 2627 3444 8095 expiration 05/04.
.....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.
I said calm down and shut the fuck up. What's your problem?
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
I'm a nice and reasonable man. I didn't do anything wrong. Please don't make me hurt you. And I'm telling you: that if you ever hurt me or if you hurt someone that I love.....I will hurt you many, many, many times over.....because it's not right to take people's trust.
That's that.
Yeah.
...no....I don't....I don't remember you. Who's this?
No thanks.
What happened?
I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
Ok.
Hey.
Wait a minute --
Well....what do you want, then?
You can't be late.
Ok.
You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
Your expenses are your own.
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
So they'll go.
Uch. Shut up, Dean.
Nothing.
Yeah.
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
"And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --"
We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
And --?
One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
You mean to take us all down with you?
He can't do that to me.
I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create --
Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape!
It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.
Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?
I saw the longing in your eye --
Don't confuse one organ with another --
Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to welcome you to Charenton --
You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.
What is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?
Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
It was not inspired by circumstance.
I'll do everything in my power --
I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.
I've stared into the face of evil...  ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down.
His wife was trying to escape; they caught her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets.  "There but for the grace of God"... eh, Doctor?
I'll pass the word on, then.
Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
"The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."
Yes?
Don't start --
There's something else I want from you.
Most assuredly.
A kiss for each page.
The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
I am not a wealthy woman.
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
Good God, Marquise --
No, when I was but a tender lad--
And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
The actor
Louis
And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.
Oh, why is that?
There's no call for that language-
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
Sir?
He lied to me
I want blood
That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
What are movies about, Orson?
Oh for Christ's sake-
Please don't say this.
Now remember he's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he can't stop us from--
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
So speaks the court jester.
Sorry to disappoint.
I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!
When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world too - - I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories. But all that's finished for me--
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're dying. What's the last image that comes to you? Right now.
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
"And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?"
Who owns this town? Who runs every goddamn studio? The tribe, baby. These fuckers hear the word "Jew" and they start sweating. Like Ester Williams' pool they start sweating.
Christ.
As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
That's for me to decide.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing with the stockholders in New York who are scared shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll do what I can to--
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
Let's go, Jake, wake up!
I'm Ok.
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
Here's your carrots. You're in such a hurry. You can't wait.
Where you going at this hour?
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
What's wrong?
Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
You wasn't with her?
He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.
Except fall down like a normal person.
Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
Screw you, Jack.
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
What do you mean, "you"?
But you said "you."
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
You sound bitter.
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
It feels real good.
I can't find my ball.
Can you see it?
Come over here.
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
Who asked you?
What?
Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.
What did I do?
What'd you see?
What're you talking about?
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
I didn't do anything wrong. I swear. I just had a few drinks.
With Salvy, eh?
I'll say anything you want me to say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked Tommy. I fucked your brother. I fucked everybody! What do you want to hear? I sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
I'm leaving you Jake.
Don't make no difference no more.
Can't you get the money from your friends?
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
This is the baby sitter.
She never left the apartment --
Feel a little foolish?
Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately?
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.
Like what?
A possibility.
Congratulations, Jeff.
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
You're never going to marry?
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her.
How did you know!
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
Huh?
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
Smart? She'll be arrested!
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
Depends on the quote. Let's see -- there's the plane tickets over, import duties, hidden taxes, profit markups --
Something big going on somewhere?
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
Tired?
For what?
If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --
Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
Don't you ever have any problems?
Now, Lisa --
What is it you're looking for?
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
Yeah.
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
I'll rephrase the question.
Feel okay?
You satisfied or you want more?
What you say your name was?
You see any cops?
I think I should go home.
No.
What can you do when you have to be a man?
Well, now--
Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V.
That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it?
He's just loaded, honey.
I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but--
Excuse me--but--You know where I can find--I mean I don't remember his last name--
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
I got to go in.  You better get home too.  Hey--what?
Who has?
Yeah?
They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there?
Man, you're schizoid!
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
No.  At dawn.
Plato!
What?
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
Leave me alone.
No.
I don't know why--!
And your folks didn't understand?
Chicken?
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
Bully for you.
A what?
Neither can I.
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
Sure.  Lots of times.
No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
Why don't we just rent it for the season?
What?
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.
You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
What's he like?
He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
That one?
You weren't looking for company, were you?
No.  Why?
With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
Gabriel, let him go --
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
You promised me!
He wants... your "sister"...
To all those cons...
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
Toys for... adults?
Slinky's in aisle five, Twister's in aisle one, Moon Mud's in aisle four.
I told you, Nick. Remember?
You need a COAT!
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.
You motherfucker.
You told him about Nick's letters.
...maybe I die for Nick...
They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--
What?
I saved your life.
No --
But you were saying you were...
Yes!
So you could get down her chimney.
What'd they call her in high school?
You knew the place --
I don't know.
Hey, it's... been two years --
Rather be back in the Mountain?
Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --
No way.
Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
Can't be attracting attention, right?
Get in the CAR!
Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.
Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me...
Where is he?! Where is he?!
Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
Hi, Santa Claus, how are you. He's with Sears, I'm with Wal-Mart, twas the season...
Cancer-sucker.
Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. His lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray.
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
You want that for here or to go?
You gotta get someone upstairs.
Hell you haven't.
We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
Why you gotta say a thing like that.
She's using a new perfume.
Oh.
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
Thought you hate your old man.
Tell Ashley... I...
They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
I... sorry, Mister...
You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
The motherfucker killed Vic.
Nuts. We got a big meeting in Vegas coming up. And we're kinda just gettin ready for that right now.
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
How can you tell?
I can do that.
I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
How is he?
Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a point here. You're gonna make me lose my train of thought.
But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here. Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name...  ...you won't want to be you. Okay, quickly.  Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.
What's she doin' now?
She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
Like hell I am.
Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
Aren't you?
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
Follow you where?
Why?
I'm okay.
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
Do you know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool?
Want a smoke?
Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
I think he's just passed out.
Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
We don't think this place is safe.
So you wanna git bit, huh?
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
Not these guys.
You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
It doesn't matter who they are.
But you eat, don't you?
Steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire.
Like what?
Get back to the horses. They're straggling.
We can't stay here!
I'll make the soap myself.
I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
I don't want to run short.
Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
Sure. What other reason would there be?
You're not bein' quite fair.
Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
Stop it -- stop it.
You got no business snoopin' around --
That sure smells good.
You're sure there's more where this came from?
Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works.  Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?
Gee, I can't.
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
No.
Well, Steve?
Are you okay?
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
Thanks.
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
Where's Shorty?
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?
Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...
Yes...
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
I think so.
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
It's the sequel.
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
What are we gonna do?
Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?
Oh.
Aww, the little bird died.
Are you?
Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
I take it you're not mad at me.
Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her.
I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe.
Hello Dwight.
You mean to tell me we're dead!
Father.
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
It says, "Ray."
Get out?! What does it say?
Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
BLOOD FEAST!
Mother? 
Bring her home... I guess.
I wouldn't give ya a nickel.
Well, your mother's going to PTA today.  We'll see what your teacher has to say. 
Carl's a jerk!
You see the sign! It's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time I'm gonna charge you! $2.99 plus one dollar is $3.99!
Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
I'm so happy I could shit.
CHIP!!
Are you Chip Sutphin?
That's cool... hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?
That's right.
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
That's nice.
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
Shhhh..
I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
It's not fair!!
I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?
Beverly, are you alright?
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
What is it, Betty?
Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson. I'd forget it if I were you.
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
Where?
Yes. She bought my sister's business.
I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.
It's not just for myself I'm asking. Her sister is here. The kid's half crazy with anxiety.
How much does she want?
Hello, Frances.
But I like teaching school.
She's a pretty good sort.
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
A man would look anywhere for her, Mary. There is something exciting and unforgettable about her -— something you never get hold of —- something that keeps a man following after her.
Weren't you afraid?
What brought you down here, Greg?
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -—
Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
No. Stay that way. I want to talk to you. I love you -— you know that?
I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you -— you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister —— whom I had lost and have found again....   
I'm going to find your sister.
But I understand her. That may be more important.
She'll have to know some time.
I'm tired of being afraid -— of waiting.
And then?
You'll be all right?
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
Such a simple matter. This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.
I can imagine.
It's not a searchlight —— it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince —- not stars --
I can't find Gregory. I've been trying to find him.
What's wrong, Mary?
Why can't everyone be happy like we are -- laugh and have good times. Look at that poor little one — so sad because she can't find her sister. And that man with her -— he doesn't make her laugh —— he just sits and talks.
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
Would they hurt her?
I know the others -- Redi, Fallon, Leo, Bruns. But I would never have guessed it of you, Natalie.
I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice —— that's it, isn't it?
Perhaps, Natalie, this is a bargain you're offering me --I am being allowed to join -- to buy safety by betraying Jacqueline -- is that it?
No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
I don't believe it.
That makes it all the more difficult ——
Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
We... don't usually let people smoke in the house. We have a patio if you --
Yes.
No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
Exactly. I would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things. Or could mean lots of things.
How long has it been since you've seen John?
Mother, father, sister.
Do I pay taxes? Of course I pay taxes, only a liar doesn't pay taxes, I'm not a liar. A liar is the second lowest form of human being.
Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
Videotapes.
You went out with her?
Maybe you want to go.
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
And now you can?
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
I've told you.
Who? Elizabeth?
Yes.
No.
Not entirely.
Don't do that.
I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
God damn you!!
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.
Yeah, I know.
Did you find him attractive?
What brought this on?
It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible?
Do you feel there is more progress to be made?
Why?
There are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad. Religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs.
Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
No, it's nothing like that.
I wanted him to see me.
You don't know that for sure.
You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
What is it?
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
About what?
And that's all?
Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.
And you ask questions, right?
Very much live.
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
What's so stupid about it?
You trust him.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
I know. Will you please leave now?
John, we have nothing to talk about.
Not for three-fifty.
Really. How'd it go?
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.
Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
You touch my spleen, Rollo.  And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy.
So who changes?
Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready?  Who cares?
Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them.
Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
BREAKING OUT
You bet, Bert.
I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.
Judge Wright?  Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
A free thinker.
I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.  We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!
Really.  What'll I pin this on?
I don't want to get up there.
Could you tell us a little about it?
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
It's...
BRAD!
F for...
Ah.  Mr. And Mrs. Majors.  How wonderful to see you.  I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley.
HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING...
Hi!  Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show.
So what's up?
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
Glass or bottle?
Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious.
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
Are you a writer too?
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
How old's she going to be?
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
You know, you could work in a wine store.
Hey Jack, hurry up!
Sure I know Maya.
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
We were supposed to play golf.
She's been leaving messages here too.
I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
That's a public course.  No Stephanie?
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
Nope.
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
Slaughterhouse.
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
Well?
What?
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
What the fuck!
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
This is good. Little hints of clove.
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
Um... yeah but it's more...
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
Well, nice to see you now.
But you wanted to fuck me first.
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
Universally rejected. Strike three.
I'm pregnant.
French or American?
I told you I need a drink.
What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.
Huh.
What's the matter?
There's dust in it.
I'm not going to curse.
Are you going to do this or what?
Pharmacy crowded?
Morgan, be careful.
He was only a year and half old.
That's good enough for me.
Graham.
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
I'm getting out now.
Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.
Don't call me Father.
I don't think so.
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
Don't do it!
What book!
I wouldn't do that. You're going to need every gun when that posse gets here.
You brought a posse to my best hideout and you want to know if I mind. Mister, I don't know any of those names and you're about to die.
...And you had to kill him?
Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me.
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
Where were you?
Maybe we'll see you sometime.
I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.
How's Mr. Parker doing?
Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
Ten A.M.
I haven't done anything.
Going to Turley, was it?
Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett. He's a friend of mine.  This is Sheriff Cobb.
Who?
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
We didn't get that far.
Who is he?
All I did was kiss the girl.
Howdy.
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.
He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
I see you're prospering without me.
This is a lot of money.
What is it you want from me?
I never could count on you to be reasonable.  Don't force me to make an adjustment around here.
Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
You work here?
And I know what I'm talking about.
Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
Why'd you go into business with him?
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
I like your attitude. But it can be risky.
Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. Treat him right.
That was my plan.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
I'm glad we talked.
No!  You will not give in to that blackmailing bitch!
-- It's called a projector.
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
You really think so?
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
-- Viktor, are you with her?  Is she there?
No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
Where are you?
Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.
Thank God for you, Faith.  I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.
You don't secretly want the attention?
Really?  She didn't mention it.
Hal, what are you doing?
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
Is she here?
I know what you mean.
I was misquoted.
It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
You have to see her.
You already do.  But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.  The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years.
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
Is she here tonight?
I know plenty of boys.
You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
If anyone asks about Simone --
I know.  Thank her for me.
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
-- No!  I can't go along with this horseshit!  Just tell them they can fry me!
Do I know you?
I'm keeping it in trust.
I traced her to a nursing home.  A young woman fitting Simone's description dropped her off five years ago.
Why?
Whatever it is, it's dark.
Am I wasting my time with you? When she sues to protect her privacy, she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it.
-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
I forgot your name.
Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and I don't want her to. I don't want her to know.
...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
Can I ask you then?
I don't know, Cole.
You weren't a paper champion.
No, we're not.
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
They did?
You can see her?
Dead people?
...I don't know.
Cole, please stop.
How did you--?
S-ssssstop it!
I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school.
'Course, it's none of my business.
What's a "little while?"
Bitch.
Slut.
Witch.
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
"Peggy-Sue" --
That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.
You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
-- And keep your eyes on the road.
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
You got something against farm people, Keith?
Shit!
Then why go back now?
Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... "Jethro."
It's you. You and your father.
No Mac, please... I --
I almost thought for a second...
She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.
Like what?
Carl.
That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
I got to leave my post.
You're lookin' awful pretty.
Meat.
It's just a work thing.
Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
You're my princess, aren't you?
Grant, no!
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
Who'd want to?
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless.
The bus'll pick you up over there.  Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
I would've come back for you.
How do you know?
-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
Why should I?
I'm begging.
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
Or in the slammer.
No.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
Go.
Six. Got it.
If I say go to two, it's really one.
Loud and clear.
Shit! No one's here.
Liquid gold.
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
What does the old Timex say?
My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  Hear that? Where's his chow?
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
What's that, pardner?
Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.
Yeah, but...
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and I'm here to tell you, your fellow CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all.
Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy thou.
Have any trouble getting here?
Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?
I'm Kate. You must be Cledus.
If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.
Uh -- well, yes, uh just in terms of the men up there now, my team, he's serving lunch and dinner and just doing general upkeep so --
No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
Is your security team armed?
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
He's giving them up?
Yeah, ye-- I -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
And this is your car, isn't it?
But there were more of you?
...I forgive you Darwin.
Are you on a land line?
I've got concerns.
His law firm, same one that hired me. Israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since.
-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I?  Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
Your attitude sucks.
No, what did you say on the machine?
And I vibe that kiddo, I do indeed, but it's one'a those fait accompli things, you have to --
Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...
They what? What? No. No. Why?
This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
What the hell -- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead!
Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just gotta outta there --
-- he's doing it then, huh --
-- okay, g'head --
Buzzy... Buzz...?
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
Got hit twice.
'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
Girl one of these fools has an FBI badge on him! Is this the one that was doing the inspection?
Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.
You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her.  Understand something: I am the real Gibarian.  Just a new incarnation.
Can it work?
A puppet.
Listen --
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
Why, who did you see?
I wish you'd told me.
Kelvin, you awake?
Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen!  This is happening, Kelvin.  Wake up.
Get out --
What do you want?
Just get him to stop.
I love her.
I'll go with you.
Don't.
You go home.
I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!
Do I really feel like... I am...?
You don't love me.
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
You never said you wanted one.
What do I have to do to stop it?
You're lying.
They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
They've got two monsters now.  Both boys.
It's terrific Win.
Occasionally.
Hi.
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
Queens... You know Queens?
I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him.
He said he'd kill me.
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
You were reading my Renoir.
They're kind of fuzzy.
You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
Good night, Mike.
What do you want?
Claire, will you calm down?
I don't know you...
I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart.
Pretty bad.
Not if you don't want me to.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
Claire...
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
What are you talking about?
Get in bed.
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
Okay?
I think -- she's crazy.
I'd identify him.
Bought it.
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?
I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.
Why not Patrol?  They'd do just as good a job.
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
Hey Mike, out of the bag into the bureau, huh... How do you like it so far?
Shit!  A Nursemaid!  My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug!  I got a 'choice' at all.
I asked for the man in charge...
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
Don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
I know where everything is.
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
Flash, drop it--
I was there.
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
What's in there?
Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
Come on, that's pure luck!  The guy was in the right place at the right time--
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
Can't focus...
Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
Frmpph-yrr.
Just call me Spidey.
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
Huh?
I-- uh--
My my.
Oh, don't do it on my account--
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
-- but at least Aunt May's okay now. I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
Aunt May, what happened?
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
I will finish what I've begun…
Your dog ate it.
Fortean phenomena.  Anomalies in our so-called reality. Weirdness, my boy, and lots of it.
This photo you took of "Spider-Man" -
What?
Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
What's wrong with him?
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
So long, Cookie. The department store is all yours. What's left of it.
A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
You make my mouth water.
What are you looking at him for?  Any objections, Sefton?
Sefton!
You won't get off that cheap.
Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
What do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove?
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
Jawohl?
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
Wisecrackers? Where did he pick up his English? In a pretzel factory?
Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
You're teasing me again!
Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you, Animal?
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!
Let me alone.
Yes, sir.
Not yet.
It's not Schulz. It's that stoolie. Whoever he is, he's sure batting a thousand.
What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.
Los, los. Dummkopf!
Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?
You told them, Hoffy.
What's the decoy?
Today's Camp News!  Father Murray announces that due to local regulations the Christmas midnight Mass will be held at seven in the morning!
Stop that, will you!  Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
Which one of us is the informer?
Talk what? I do not know anything!
This is me in Cincinnati.
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
My grandmother's ear-muffs.
But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...
Twelve years, sir.
According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
We're within range, sir.
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
That's right.
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
What's normal?
I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
Well, now that we're all aboard=8A  Number One, bring the ship before the wind.  Let's see what's out there.
There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.
Captain, are you all right?
Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
Calm yourself, Bones.
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
David, I don't understand...
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
Well. There's your life form reading. These were microbes on the tube's surface. We shot them here from Enterprise.  They were fruitful, and multiplied.
Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
I don't understand.
None that I can detect, sir.
I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
The ship... Out of danger...?
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
Will you be able to handle that...?
Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
Wait! Give me a chance --
Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board this ship on my next signal.
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
Then, how --
... He spoke of your friendship.
What must I do?
I ordered no interruptions.
They outnumber us, my Lord --
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
Good for you, Lieutenant.
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
And who am I hiding from?
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
Is that a poem?
I told you! I told you I saw a --
He left us.  We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?
You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was life, a fair chance to --
Well done, Commander.
It's a long story.
At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you?
Departing dark side, Regula.
-- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever.
Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
I'm getting a voice message... wait ... short range band. They say their Chambers coil is shorting their COMM system.
On screen.
Enterprise to Reliant: you are ordered to surrender your vessel. Respond!  Nothing, sir.
Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --
And who is this?
Yes, SIR.
Permission to come aboard, Captain?
I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?
Let's hope he hasn't changed the combination. He's quite intelligent...
And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
That's it?
Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
Mr. Saavik, all stop.
Three minutes, thirty seconds.
Aye, sir.
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
Shields activated!
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
Certainly...
Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
Fine. Just fine.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
Bones --
Hi... Busy?
Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
You, ah...  You present the appearance of a man with a problem.
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
You're saying... It is a compliment.
Who are you? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me.
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
How long?
Like what?
You play games with me and you're through
Despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return George and Gracie to the open sea.
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
You're upset about losing the whales.
Hm?
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
What do you mean now?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
I'm all ears.
But Kirk...
... Gone?!
If we keep going up, they'll catch us!
... What does that mean?
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
In progress, Admiral.
Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will...  Make a <u>guess</u>.
Can we make breakaway speed!?
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.
I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.
Scotty, how long is this bay?
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
Full power, sir.
You better get up there, sir. We're having some power fall-off...
Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
Professor Scott, if you'll --
That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
Transparent aluminum?
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
As I recall, I opposed your enlistment in Starfleet... It is possible that judgment was incorrect.  Your associates are people of good character.
You have warp capability?
The craftsmanship is extraordinary.
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
You're Ro'tin, aren't you...? There's something in the voice.  Would you be his friend Gal'na?  I helped your mother bathe you when you were a child. She still speaks of you.
Do machines ever play?
For what purpose?
Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
I have to go home now.
Hello, Data...
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
It is not over.
Understood.
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...
I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...
We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.
They're powering their forward weapons array.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
... and gorgonzolla cheese.
Worf, you must hurry...
Come out, come out wherever you are...
Scanners are off line!
Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a.
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
Or you could try lying down.
The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?
Absolutely.
It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over.  Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding.
He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
I have helm control.
But now... they are all one with the Borg.
Did you know her?
Data... are you sure you're all right?
I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.
Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...
Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.
Ready to make a little history?
Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
Where are you from most recently?
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
Were the two of you... involved?
I'd say you already have.
I have to...
No... I'm from France.
Port battery, ready sir!
Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere. It's on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface.
Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.
Are you alright?
Just a little queasy...
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
I remember it made me sick.
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
Spock, that was actually funny.
Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...
We're not finished.
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
If they're even looking for us...
Too bad we can't SMELL her.
Retire.
You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
"To be or not to be, that is the question" which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room...
That isn't true...!
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
Yes.
Torpedo room--?
From Starfleet?
Course heading, Captain?
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
How did you know...?
Aft thrusters -
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
Kronos, sir?
I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
Lieutenant, I am pleased to see you.  The Lieutenant is the first Vulcan to be graduated at the top of her class as the Academy.
I am uncertain.
I was blind. I couldn't see past the death of my son. I couldn't trust.
You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
Captain, perhaps we're going about this the wrong way; our job is to get to the conference; HER job will be to stop us.
But we haven't run out of history just yet.  Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - "the undiscovered country"...
How did you - ?
Her own father...?
A lie?
I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --
Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.
A computer canna lie, sir.
Nevertheless.
They're naturally wary, ma'am. We've been at war a long time.
Sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by...
Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.
Because you are dangerous.
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
No. Can I move now?
Remember him?
I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it's not peace.
To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochran’s own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
Sir.  I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously.
Do you think this is a wise course of action?
"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.
No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.
Why am I looking at me?
You have a red shirt.
Why?
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.
What is our approximate distance?
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
What do we know about the planet?
It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
What's he doing?
Sir?
Sir, we're being hailed.

We're being hailed.
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.
I hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light.
Praetor?
We need to talk, just you and I.
What are you doing?
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
Long ago.
Not so long.
He's a very unusual android.
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
How long until we reach the Rift?
I have a purpose.
You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guard’s whip and you'll soon understand patience.
What did I tell you?
Do you have children?
No!!! No!!!
We're going... Damn!  We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?
Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat...
Money.
I...
It was yellow.
No.
Yes.
A baby is a new person?
No... The closest...
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
What is hitchhike?
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
You want this ticket?
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.
What?
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
What are you doing?
I do not want to.
Put that back.
No. Get in.
I will go. But not you.
I feel better if I move.
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
You are cold.
Yes, they are.
It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
May I have twenty-five cents, please?
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
If you want to keep it, you can.
I'm sure we could find a country and western station.
Well...
What do I do now?
Tell the baby about me.
You sure this is your car?
My grandmother's rich.
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
I know. She bought him a ticket for Lathrop Wells and put him on the bus. He didn't stay on though and they drove off together.
Bullshit!
Very beautiful country up here...
It was a man though... right?
I don't understand.
I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
You saw that?
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.
Jesus.
I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
You have to go.  I mean it.
You talked to Iris?  When?
He has his uses too.
We should talk alone.
What kind of things exactly?
I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes.
Yeah.  No, not really.
Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect.
Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
Who was just here?
You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
I always do.
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
That would be no.
No, you're just trying to get off.
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
And gives it to you.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
Shit!
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.
A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?
Just Lenny.
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
Have you had a chance to think about --
Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?
Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
What's the bad news?
What does the Manager say?
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
What?
The family has gone through a lot. Their daughter missing, the search, her body found, the funeral -- then this order to exhume the corpse.
A grill pattern.
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
Not bad, huh?
There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
Maybe cause he's smart.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
I don't believe this.
"Murman" was the alter identity of William Heirens, the original "Catch Me Before I Kill Again" killer. Short for "Murder Man." It was the case that got Richard Low and I started in this field.
We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
Don't you touch him.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
Not especially.
Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
He thinks he looks young.
He's called a couple times.
No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.
Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
Maybe we should back off a bit.
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
What's up?
You were right. He found me.
It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong.
But why this pattern?
All the same killer?
How did you know Speck was a killer?
Yes.
Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.
How do you know who's real and who's not?
It was the mall.
We're alike. We are hunters. We have the gift. It's ancient times all over again. We stand between order and chaos. I need help. I can't carry on alone.
Maybe you should back off.
Was it Zero?
[Fantasy time, girls, give it up, give it up.]
I've been to Chicago.
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
[You tell me.]
[What does the file say?]
Four hundred and sixty, sir.
But why attack an Agent?
Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo.
I don't know about that.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
You're a comedian?
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
Nikki.
I'm Mike.
Like the quiche?
Why? You're not a real man?
...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
Like what?
Charles! What's up, man?
They're out of Glenlivet.
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
A couple of high rollers like you?
You want this in black chips.
There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...
You're a comedian?
I'll have to come see you sometime.
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
...Six months.
How are you doing?
Yeah.
You know, us.
Why didn't you call?
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
Hey man, don't sweat it.
I mean, I need the money.
What'd you get?
An eight.
Sounds more like Aids...
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
You want to talk about it?
I didn't make it...
Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it.
Pause it. 
You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg?
You live in such a fantasy world...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
S'up Trent?
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
She smiled baby.
It doesn't matter...
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
You think they're watching?
You gotta do it.
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
That was so demeaning...
Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
What was the part?
Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
No!
...So give me the fuckin part...
No, man. I need to use the phone.
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
I just need some time...
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
What?!?
What time's this party tonight?
Was I money?
Is she looking now?
Now go over there and get those digits.
It's on.
You don't have to wait three days...
...Well, then, I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore.
...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.
Godfather.
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood?
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
How bad will it be?
You think we'll go for that last place?
Should I bring him in.
When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
But you needed a drink first.
No, I wanted other things for you.
I'll need him.
Yes.
You want him to stay in this country.
Godfather, you understand everything.
Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
Mike, you sure about Moe selling. He never mentioned it to me and he loves the business.
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call...
Will you give this letter to Michael.
Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?
Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
Who is he?
Then Luca turned to the other man...
Michael, I love you.
I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
And what do you want for Christmas?
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
He'll be OK.
I LOVE YOU.
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
Huh?
Please say it.
You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.
I can help you out...
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
That's not how Pop would have played it.
I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
A million times.
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
He talked to you?
Buy me out?...
You're unlucky.
Is he alive?
You'd say if you mind?
I don't like you.
Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party.
You like jazz!
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
I have to go to Venice.
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
I know. I write like a child.
Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
What's the fight about? That's her fiancee, isn't it? Are they blaming him?
She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way...
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.
The landlady -- as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now.
Mr Greenleaf.
I'm well, thank you.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
Marge has been telling us about the rings.
We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
Where's Mr MacCarron?
I don't know, I don't know, I just know it.
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.
That ring's so great. The green one.
Did he kill Freddie?
Did Dickie's Dad go?
He's having an early night.
But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day.
Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
I hope so.
That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.
What's funny?
Excuse me?
Emily.  Just kidding.
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
I know.
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
Just kidding. Are you alone?
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
And don't forget. I have the key.
So, the Doctor, he has to make the --  -- come se dice?
Can we go up? Do you mind?
November 7th is my information.
A few days ago.
It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. There must be fifty hotels in San Remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day.
Thank you.
It is a little coarse, yes.
Absolutely.
Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then the next.
Huh?
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
What hours do you work?
You know what you remind me of?
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
But... Betsy...
Hello, Travis.
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
Have you been noticing anything strange?
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
How long has he been there?
Oh, are you all right?
You sure he's not Italian?
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
Awh, come off it, Pal.
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose!
Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think!  What do I have to do? Draw you a picture?
You said that?
She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk.
I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat.
One-Ball McCall?
You looking for some action?
I don't remember.
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
I musta been stoned.
Don't you want to go?
Why?
God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me.
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
So why do you want to be a taxi driver?
Some. Here and there.
Are you a Secret Service Man?
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
Shit.
I'm here to see Iris.
That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
It's me sir.
Wrong.
I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
Partners?
St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.  Front pew.  Right leg. = Hollow.
This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
You've got everything?
Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
I think  it's worse  now.
Me too.
You look... different.
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
Right here.  "Albert Lucas Trumbo." And all the others.  I knew them all.  So did you.  We went to school with most of them.
And why not?
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
Well, there's got to be a way...
Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.
Are you saying that he's...
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
Harry, son.  Harry.
And... what's my name again?
You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead.
Nine and-a-half years ago.
Um... Harry?  Did I ever keep the books here?
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
Here, one of mine.
I... no, I... I just can't...
... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me.
Who the hell is this "they?"
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!
So, it is a blacklist.
That's not the country Luke fought for.
Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
What do you mean?
Well, that's not what they think.
Sit.  Play with me.
Found me.
We thought you was dead, you know.  It's okay that I live here?
Please, sit.
I suppose.  Thanks.
My girlfriend.  If she still is...
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
Yes.
Yes.
Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
If you have some, I'd...
How do you like our little hamlet?
What do you mean?
A trifle.
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
Cathy!
No!
They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.
Oh, I suppose so.
Don't you like us?
Mitch, let's turn back.
Lois!
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
Yes?
I see. How do I get down there?
Of course.
The little girl's name.
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
What happened?
We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch.
Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want it at the table?
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
Seven o'clock, same as usual.
Well... well, is everyone all right?
Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
When do you think they'll come?
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
I started to say... inside...
Do you think Cathy's all right?
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children.  When Frank died...  You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
Did you close the door?
Shhhh. Shhhh.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
Is that for Mitch Brenner?
Doesn't what make me...?
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
What did you say?
A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. 
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
I think you're a louse.
Ouch!
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
You like me, huh?
I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.
Famished.
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
Yes, but...
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
Why?
What do you want ?
What?
Last night? What do you mean?
Do you want some mustard with this?
It smelled of the fire.
Really? Tell me about it.
What it was, probably...
After the gulls attacked.
I think it's safe to get out now.
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, please?  Yes, I'll wait.
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
You must leave this house.
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
Not yet.
The white horse.  The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.
Aye, but I still wonder how much.
I thought this was a school day.
A doctor?
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
It might be an interesting case.
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
This is a gift.
You say you've come here on your own account?  No one knows you are here?
Burke them?
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
Was the paralysis immediate?
Yes, Doctor.
A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
How long ago?
She would if she could.
You're daft.  What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten.
What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
We won't.
Two down. Two to go.
I was hoping you'd find out.
That was a fucking hollow point!
Sssshhh. She's resting.
You lied at my trial.
What did they give you?
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
Erin. Who?
Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
Could say that.
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
You want me to walk a straight line?
Are you ok?
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
You're in with them.
You killed her!
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
You wrote this?
I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting.
Such power exists?
Yes.
Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.
Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
What does that mean?
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
I mean the reasons for my coming here.
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations.
Now that you understand the situation more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the President
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
What about him?
How do you know?
Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!
Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.
Oh -- hello--
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.
It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.
"Klaatu barada nikto."
I'm sorry.
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!
Burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>!
We've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time.
Good.
Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid.  I don't trust 'em.  I say we terminate 'em while we can.
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
You can't kill me, Star.
This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
No, Nanook!  Quiet!
Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
Who, Laddie?
It's early.  Why do we have to go home?
No.  I'm up.
What's wrong?  Tell me.
Sam!  What happened!?  You had me scared to death.  Are you all right?
Nanook, stop breathin' on me.
Mom!
Say hello to Thorn.
This looks terrific, Lucy.
Me, too.
Now you and David...
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
I have to talk to you.  Can I come up?
Why not?
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
Wanna go to the comic book store?
Michael?
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
Sixteen.
What do you mean "got" to the dog?
How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?
What the hell you looking at me like that for?
Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
Watch Clark.
What?
Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut.
Let's open it.  Now...
Was dark... find a light...
Well, who's got access to it?
How many in their party?
Hey, man...!
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
Don't let up, Childs!
Sanchez...?  Hey, who...
Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...
Where was he trying to go?
Then we go after him.
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
MacReady...?
You hear that?
How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?
Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  I'll find her.
... Well, you wanted to see it.
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
In for a penny, in for a pound.  Do you know that saying?
This has to end.
Vox --
Vox...
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
And what of the Eloi?
They survived above.  Became what they are.
Say I just come back again?
If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...
No...
I know.
I don't think that's going to happen.
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
You know, the moment is rather dying here.
I know it's not a diamond but --
A moonstone.
Holding you... again.
Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them?
All right.  I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed?
I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
You seem fascinated by the stars.
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
We all have that dream.
The mud carriers.
And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
Someone you loved very much.
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
So you can use it now?
Oh huzzah, the master's home.
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
No, sir --
Yes, sir.
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
Yes, sir.
We'll see about that.
No, you're safe --
They're inside --
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
And you've no idea where he went?
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
He's recovering on the third floor.
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
Long live the Organization for the Organized!
That's too bad.
Becker, how do you sleep at night?
I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it?
That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.
You done with your small talk?
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
No, it hasn't.
I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
I have no idea.
Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days.
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
I've been ok.
It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?
You were convicted of the crime.
That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
Exactly.
Well, what time is it?
Because I don't have time.
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.
Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
I'm not sure.
Why "of course"?
I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...
Yup. That's me.
You like it?
Well, good for you.
But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?
I'm sorry.
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
You want anything special for dinner?
... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
We spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a Miss Louise Sawyer.  Do you know her too?
Could you identify 'em, if ya saw 'em again?
Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?
It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
Hey.
Now, for one thing, you violated your parole two days out.  And you know Judge Hainey.  He hates this sort of thing.  Once he gets wind of this, he's gonna blow sky high.  And then when he finds out that you're a possible accessory to murder and armed robbery, well, I think we can safely place your ass back in the slammer for at least the remaining eight, don't you?
Stop.
You're beautiful.  It's okay.  I won't hurt you.  It's okay.
Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  I've never been with anybody but Darryl.
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
You're in Oklahoma?!
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?
I'm the one... I never made it work. I just... It's not that I don't love you.  It's not that.  I just never thought I'd be thirty-six years old and I never thought... I don't know what I thought.  What do you want, darlin'.  What do you want me to do.
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
Alright...  I changed my mind.  I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
Call him?
I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives!  Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?!  I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit!
You're disturbed.
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
You mean now or before?
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.
What?!
Ready?
I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.
You do?
What?
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
I said all that?
What do you mean?
Thelma, that is not an option.
You know what's happened, don't you?
We probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.
What?!
What in the hell is it?!
We're not giving up, Thelma.
Say you're sorry.
This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking?
Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
Whatever happened to Mary?
I mean since then.
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
Never met him.
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
I don't know what to say.
Mints?
Hm?
You know, clean the pipes.
Why's that?
So... I see you made the news.
Uh-huh. Where was he?
Mary.
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
Same here again.
I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect -- it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is my hobby.
I beg your pardon?
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school.
Three different guys?
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
You bet.
Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
How'd you manage that one?
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
I can live with those reflections.
What's that supposed to mean?
So who's the lucky guy?
Good lookin'?
Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
He's dead.
We should play some time... I mean, if you can afford to lose some money.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
Mary, come on...
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
So what's up?
See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
Piggyback ride.
Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President. We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.
Well, I'm not.
We were just debating who had it worse, us or George Washington and his guys.
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
Jesus...
And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey.
Yeah?
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
Then they should speak up.
Every day the sun comes up... says something about us.
I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson.
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
An invasion...
How long until the army is ready?
We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
I want an hour with him.
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
I don't like what's happening.
I'm your political advisor, and I'm giving you political analysis here. This is a setup. The Chiefs want to go in. It's the only way they can redeem themselves for the Bay of Pigs. They have to go in, and they have to do it right. It's that simple.
I don't want to listen to this again.
If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short...
Just a second, Mr. President.
Hey. Nice tie.
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow like you, doing in a joint like this? Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like.
A murder. On the reservation.
South Dakota...  Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir?
Were you in Nam?
How'd you know?
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
It may have been Maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.
He said he doesn't know.
The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week.
So what?
He also said "listen to the water."
So did this one. Wambli is a rare and sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But you think that's bullshit too, don't --
What you call myths, we call our history.
It's not real.
Where was this?
Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
He's gone.
Thank you.
At Sioux Falls Pen?
What's with you people? Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? I came through, man.
What the fuck, man? What do you people want? I did what you wasi'cu's told me to do.
No way. No fuckin' way.
Miles. Three other suits. That's all I know 'em as -- suits. Were you there?
What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn.
I'll bet!
I could be, too.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
I thought he'd never leave.
It would have been really embarrassing!
Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
Where did you see that?
Yes, ma'am.
You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
Apology acknowledged.
Harmless!
And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just...I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm immune...
I'm different.
It's not suffering anymore.
Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
You always get what you want?
I want it understood.
He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.
How does it go?
You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
Take something off.
You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back.
I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
F-14's sir.
Sir?
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
MAVERICK.
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?
We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it down.
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
What do I want?
What do you want?
What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
So's my Johnson.
I've lost him -- where is he?
Great move. Great
Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
No shit! That why they call him Ice?
We did it.
You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.
The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
I...FORGOT SOMETHING.
It was bad.
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
Why?
I lost.
All right.
I called your house.
You may not think so, but you are.
Would you take me back? Would they?
Well, there it is; the Last Resort.  Sure you wanna go in?
Why not?
What happened to number five?
Need a ride?
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.
He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
Sleazy...and demure.
Suppose I do...then what?
Pull them out.
Shit!
Hey Harry...Harry!  You ever heard of Rekall?
Yeah, you did.  I told you not to but you did anyway.
How did I get in this taxi?!
The fare is eighteen credits, please.
Nobody?!  What's her name?
I don't know.
Yeah, sweetheart?
Let's do it.
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
You went to those brain butchers?!
What did they do to you?  Tell me!
Implanted.
Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.
What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
No options.
I give up.
You.  You're the same.  No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you.  Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip".
They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!
Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
Forget I said wife.
Yeah, like they got a plan...
Yeah, still got one poking around.
How much you think?
What the hell is that, anyway?
Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.
Oh, Jesus!!
Fifteen lousy bucks.
That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.
Pham Van don't get his mitts on <u>this</u> for no measly fifteen bucks!
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
What?
Well, I brung her something I know she likes.
Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
What?
Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
Around here?  Why would they?
You paying attention?  This oughta hurt like hell.
Yeah, they're confused.  They can feel our vibrations, but they can't find us.
Wait!  How are you going to know they're all following it?
From Chinatown... Which is right up the street from the morgue! Where did you go with the body? What did you do with it?
You're fishing. You don't know shit.
He was your snitch.
True.
Ms. Vin's sister.
I'm a lawyer. The firm is thinking about renovating. Everything dates back to the Sixties.
"Art's Supplies" is founded on trust, Mister --
What, "everything"? You shot a corpse. I don't give a shit about that -- !
Let's snuff this lowlife!
How can you remember that?
Not the whole time, of course. I --
You see that? You wanna be like that?
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
It's just... I leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in Chicago and in three dizzying weeks I've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer --
At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone.
Some gang punk gets wasted in front of the tourists. The mayor pressures the cops. The cops pressure the rival gang -- the Joe Boys. The Joes give up Shu Kai Kim -- the schmuck kid from Korea who's been pestering 'em to get in.
Do you have to do that?
There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony!
Uh, Eddie? The, um, ballistics guy, George...? He called, and...  His tests show that Shu's gun fired the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin.
Eddie Dowd.
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
So what're we gonna do?
Hey -- you believe what you want. Shu Kai Kim is innocent.
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
They're Chinamen who speak English. We call them informants.
So there goes your theory about the Joes giving up Shu to protect their trigger man.
A fucking wheelchair?
Eddie this is silly... are we supposed to pretend nothing's happened in the last ten years and --
I don't need sleep!
Afraid of what?
No. You tell me, Shu.
...You told the Desk Sergeant you were certain Mr. Kim wasn't the killer?  You left your telephone number?
Shu Kai Kim.
Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?
But now you've strayed from your area of expertise -- dope -- into street assassins. A subject on which you're dangerously ignorant.
To the best of your recollection, were you sober when you performed the tests?
We just discovered him, your Honor! His appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case! He is an inmate at Ossining Correctional and --
-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two.
Then it was your idea to have Chuckie Roeder scare Eddie off the case?
And why was an exception made?
What color hair will she have?
Tell me some other things about her.
I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. My boys have been all over this. It's a dead end.
OK, Gordon.
Congratulations. I heard about that.
And neither will I.
I cracked the Whiteman case with this.
Someone else has it now.
He's dead -- good and dead.
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
We're heading into a difficult situation.
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
Are you speaking to me in a code?
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
You didn't do your homework?
Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough.
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
James called me last night looking for you.
He probably wanted to drive over.
Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
You mean Fred and Ginger?
Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.
Why do you do it, Laura?
Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
Fill 'er up.
You missed somethin', Ed.
I did? I didn't see anything.
Even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain.
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love.
Laura, you didn't come and see me today.
I'm not.
I already made you two tapes.
We're on our way, Baby.
Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
Oh, Laura.
What?
What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
See what?
You're getting warmer.
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
The Norwegians are coming next week and I want you to learn to say what I just learned in Norwegian. So you can talk to them. I want you to learn to say, "Hello, my name is Leland Palmer".
School?
Who was that?
A friend from school.
We're late to get to your mother.
Did you come home during the day last week?
Neither is mine. And can't we talk about something serious for a change.
Bobby didn't give you this?
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
What are you doing?
Lay off the bennies, Leo.
Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
You're right. There's no one here.
Mr. Abraham...
Good.  You ever been inside a hospital?
How good's your intelligence?
I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
It's a crime.
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct?
How old are you?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
We went to Code Blue...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isn't that what you did?
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
It's all right, Mickey.
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much...
...that's perfectly all right.
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
Thank you.
Mrs...
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
One hour.
Yessir. I'm sorry.
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
I had a witness disappear on me.
Yes. It was, actually.
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice.
And it's over...?
I...
Maybe I'll tell you later.
I have to talk to you.
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
You know what happened.
A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
...we, we love her, Dick and me...
...I'm sure you do...
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
...I understand...
We just can't do it anymore.  This is our chance to get away.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him...
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
I have to talk to you.
...I'm going to need your help...
...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
No.
Jimmy? Bushmills.  Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?
You use their witness.
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
Huh.
Hurry up!  Jump in!
Good to see you, General.  This is Pastor Collins, director of Civil Defense.  Sheriff Bogany, head of the local forces ... Miss Van Buren.
Is that... machine...?
It's gone now.
A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
How'd you guess?
That needle ain't pointing north!
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
They don't do much of anything...!
Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
So I don't know about horror.
Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
No, you don't.
What's up?
Like Freddy.
No.
Dylan?  He's holding well.  Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
These look quite fresh.
He was just here!
You going away?
Someone's coming.
Dylan, I gotta go.  Forgive me?
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
And...what's the man doing?
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
When do you think it'll be done?
What...happened?
A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
Really?
Yes.
I want to see the body.
No time like the present.  The car will bring you.
Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?
That low passed through last night. May be a little bumpy out there.
What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
I doctored my grades so I'd make the cut.  I'm a moron, okay?  You satisfied?!
You know, I never had friends like this.
I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".
What's the difference?
Listen man, I think I have a problem.
Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II?
Do you have your ticket?
I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it?
I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
Of what?
Of a fight he can't win out here.
But you invited is aboard.
It will be more than that, I can promise you.
Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.
Who is it Philip?
You do?
Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't.
Hell, they even kicked me outa vo- tech 'cause I couldn't read a slide rule.
What's your problem?
It matters to me.
Why, man?
Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.
This isn't just a story!!  It's history made allegory.  It is a philosophical handbook for life!  It holds the secret of this very voyage.
It hurts too much to care.
What are we supposed to talk about?
Phil.  What are you doing?
Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
What makes you so sure it was one?
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
It wasn't hard.
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
Whisper it... Whisper "fuck me"... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper...
Fuck me.
Hell, no, belongs to my girl's sister. The sister's been over to New Orleans, lets us have it while she's gone. Where's that pretty little lady of yours today?
Ready for another?
Be easy, Sailor. There's two employees. I take one in the back to open the safe, you keep the other'n covered... You ain't plannin' on raisin' a fam'ly in Big Tuna, are ya?
Hey... I never said you was a pussy... Always figured you had the big ol' round balls for this kind'a thing... Sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good.
Nice of you to drop by.
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
Club Zanzibar.
It's none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.
Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.
That is my permiso.
He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing.
You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
I knew this would happen. Soon as that piece of filth got out of Pee Dee, I knew there'd be trouble. He's just got some kind of influence over her I can't decipher. There's somethin' wild in Lula I don't know where it comes from. You gotta find 'em, Johnnie.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
Really, Marietta, you got more scenarios swimmin' around in your brain than Carter got pills. Try to take it easy. Go over to Myrtle Beach for a few days.
I got some news, Marietta. Lula and Sailor been here. They checked out of the Hotel Brazil on Frechman Street yesterday.
Did she tell you where she was callin' from?
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad...
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
Why, honey?
Hey baby...
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.
You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know? Where I was makin' a jelly and banana sandwich? I remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin' that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters. Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter.
He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.
I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.
He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald.
There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.
Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O.
Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?
Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em?
What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?
Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?
Where?
Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.
One bad car accident...
Not bad for eleven dollars a day.
You find any work?
Anything I can do for you?
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
What?
You must be my son.
I'm sorry, Sailor. I just can't help it. Give me a minute and I'll quit.
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
What if I told you not to?
Get rid of him?
Santos...
Shoot him.
Where?
No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
See! I knew you had it all under control.
Someone's gonna see us.
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
No.
No... I just wanted to kiss you good- bye... You know too much 'bout little Lula's mom...
You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
I know... I remember.
What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
Actually... I just want to go home.
I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
How are you, Crabtree?
Emily?
I thought you were tinkering.
Trip??
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but right now I --
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
So tell me about you and the Chancellor.
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
You must be mistaken.
You did.
How long have you been having them?
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
Hello?
Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
...reconcile with Emily.
Sounds like a good one.
They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
You cold, James?
It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
That's a big book you're writing.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
Isn't this...?
It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town.
Carvel.
Outside Scranton.
Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.
I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions.
Kinship. And what's here?
It feels really... good... here.
So, why did you take me up there?
The hell I am.
Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog?
Yes, Hannah?
Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
She's left before...
Hm.
Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
Not have it.
You heard? How?
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
And what do you think you might have said?
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
Tony. Now that I'm home.
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
Holy shit. Are you serious?
I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.
No, the dog.
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
George Sanders?
You want to keep him happy.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
Foreman now.
No shit.
Beautiful. How's business?
I was just thinking of... the noise.
I should go. Your sister worries, and when she worries she yells.
Annette? She's good... tense.
When can I see her?
Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
Next week? The week after?
It's not what you think.
You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.
You don't have to tell me this.
Carlos, I never raped a woman.
Carlos, can I ask you something?
What are you looking at?
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
You always carry these?
Try.
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
I have to go.
I would.
Doesn't everybody?
No.
I was asleep.
He I.D.'d the assailant. The description matches you pretty well.
I'd say you're moving.
Apartment's okay.
But you are taking it?
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
I'm twelve.
A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.
No thank you.
I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there?
Ms. Kramer.
Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does.
What will happen if I do?
Can't I stay a little longer?
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
What?
I'd like you to keep a journal.
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
Reflect.
No fucking way.
I don't feel anything.
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
No, I am not going to --
Not so fast.
Sorry.  Where is she?
Did you get an erection?
It was a small house.
What?
I'm all right.
Most women wouldn't choose it.
What about bears?
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
I get that impression.
It's been a while since...
Molested little girls?
I never hurt them. Never.
Twelve years in prison?
Why don't you just go now, okay?
What?
You mean the time you're locked away?
Their power. They seduce me.
And what do you tell yourself now?
Most people say the odds are against me.
What odds?
I love my brothers.
Live together.
It's a bad idea.
Don't be scared, Walter.
How you guys doing?
What's goin' on, Boss?
Where are we?
I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?
Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
Wasn't up to me.
Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.
You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.  What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What would have you done?
I haven't worn mine in months.
Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or anything?
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
Try again.
Well, that's that.
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
I don't know how!
We've only got one suit.
Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.
Alright, put this on.
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.
Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.
Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
What's you depth, Cab Three?
Then how come you're not with him?
I'd like to find a place where I can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I'd like to try...
How are you?
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
But how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands. Could be that something might turn up there.
Have you decided?
How wonderful!
As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... Why, even this morning... that business about the shark... it wasn't at all true.
Nothing but the usual argument... The only thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that she said she had a need to be alone.
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
Are you joking?
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...
Claudia, let's get married?
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
But you know it already. Why must I tell you?
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
Aren't you going to change?
I don't love you.
What do you mean by sensible?
Please, you come too...
Looks like the weather is changing.
But how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?
There too...
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
First let the poor thing have something to eat.
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
Yes, sir. Three times.
Patrizia, what are you going to do?
I would like to ask you something.
I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fianc‚.
He loves you the way you are.
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
It's a sin to be fat.
Agnes...
I'm not hungry.
Why?
Why?
It's not that... it's not that...
That wasn't me.
What would you like to talk about.
First thing that comes to your mind?
Do you think he loves you?
And you like that?
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
Why should they?
Do you remember the night they said it came?
And what happened?
Where did the baby come from?
The baby they made up.
No.
Why do you smoke?
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
How did she know that?
... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
But you're troubled... aren't you?
Agnes. What did your mother do to you?  If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you?  Did she make you do something you didn't want to?  Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it?  Did it embarrass you?  Did it... did it hurt you?  What did she make you you do?
She's dead isn't she?
She can.
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
And that you're stupid?
Yes.
Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a... warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me.
Did you know what was going to come out?
Why?
To be a mother?
What made it grow?  Do you know?
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
Do you know who put it there?
Who?
Yes.
No...
I hate him...
Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she?
Yes.
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law.
Larry...
I don't know.
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
I'll have it.
I can get you new evidence next week.
Hello, Mama  ... brought you something.
Who are you?
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
Do you still go to church?
But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
What man had access to her?
Look, someone gave her the baby.
The science of psychiatry.
Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
What's your opinion?
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
I've already told you what I thought.
Who?
Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
Not simple, no.
Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
Then help her.
Oh, some time in January.
What is it?
What sheets?
You lied to me
Do you know what she did to her?
There is more here than meets the eye isn't there?  Lots of dirty little secrets.
I knew that after the fact.
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
Fine thanks...
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
For Agnes.
The father!
Who is he?
How  ?
Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
Where is she?
You went to the room to help with the birth.
You wanted that child out of the way.
And the baby.
You tied the cord around its neck.
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
Before or after you killed the child?
I left it with her and I went for help.
She can't remember.
They're yours.
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Oh, it's all right.
Yeah?
Spoil sport!
Yeah, you know, "O.K. Buster, follow that car, there's a sawbuck in it for you if you get real close!"
Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?
We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.  Can he read?
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
Ringo!
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
Should I say it?
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
Oh!
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
Are you pulling my leg?
Aye, I knew you were.
The big hammer?
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
A book!
You're only right.
What are you doing?
I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
What's he on about?
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
Come on let's get this coffee.
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
Is that yours?
Aye, he looks a right lurker.
Eh ... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?
What little old man?
How d'you reckon that one out?
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
What's old got to do with it?
No.
Ah, go on, you swine.
Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.
Aye, but you know him well.
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
Look after him.
Oh, down the ... er ...?
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
What's the matter with you? You were bashing away like a madman.
Oh, a little savage, is he?
So you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good.
Are you in pain?
Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?
Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
Yes!
How long to fix?
Hard to say.
You know what they make this stuff out of?
And when will you be ready to do that?
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here.
While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net.
I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission.  I think we should go after them.
What do you mean, no?
I've got 'em!  They're back on my screens!
Look at that.
Recognizable!  In that?
In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.
Air lock?
Oh God, oh God no.
No, thank God... just missed him.
We're going home.  We're in hyperspace.
We'll have to catch it and eject it from the ship.
And what do we do when we find it?
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
That's the one about the albatross, right?
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
Okay.
All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
But?
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
What's it doing, having a seizure?
This is all the same creature.  We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle.
Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
You know, it's funny -- this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up -- this treasure, the paydirt -- it'll make it back to Irth just fine -- even if we're not with it.
And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
Headache?  Dehydration?
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
And?
When?
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
If I can get to the chopper, I'll meet you at the rendezvous.  Don't wait for me.
What's wrong?
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!
There's still time to back-out.
Thanks.
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
I'm serious.  That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary installations.
Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
What?
What can I do?
What time's sundown?
'Bout five minutes.
I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...
I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
I'm about to go into the shower, I won't be able to hear you...
She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?
I don't think that's funny.
Aren't you?
What time?
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
What do you take me for?
A dull cliche.
Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski.
Why not?
No, it's not.  It's for this.
Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler," can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler...
What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
Then you've heard too.
I was there. An eyewitness.
Margo? Lunching in public?
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
You mustn't worry about your little charge. She is in safe hands.
I guess at this point I'm what the French call 'de trop'...
Forty-five minutes from now my plane takes off and how do I find you? Not ready yet, looking like a junk yard-
Only in some ways. You're prettier...
Hi.  My wonderful junk yard. The mystery and dreams you find in a junk yard-
She's quite a girl, that what's-her name...
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do-
Then you're crazy.
I leave in a week - the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night... those previews. Like opening out of town, but terrifying. There's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can-
Happy little housewife...
Cut it out.
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
So she seems.
Thank you.
I must have frightened her away.
Okay. Mix.
Then what would be enough?  If we were married?
Just wondered what?
Is it the money?
It's only one picture deal.
I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
Is that what you want me to be?
So am I.
- and for you.
You're quite a girl.
Buy some.
Of course!
Oh, brother.
There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-
Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
What are you doing here?
That's the door.
To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
You see the play? You've seen the play every performance?  But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
Oh, no...
There isn't another like you, there couldn't be-
There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me-
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
Of course.
I won't forget.
I've got a lot to say. And none of it is easy.
Yes, you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.
Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Richards. I think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it, Mr. Richards?
I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time-
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
Well - what do you think of my elegant new suit?
That's my job.  See you at tea time...
Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
Some snowy night in front of the fire... in the meantime, while we're on the subject, will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? The caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn't dry or something...
Miss Channing, I can't tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late.
Really, Eve? Why?
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
I just can't believe it.
With tears?
But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
Lloyd, what happened...?
And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
Where'd you get all that information?
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
You've got to admit it would be a novelty.
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
The general atmosphere is very Macbethish. What has or is about to happen?
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
Twentyish. It isn't important.
Margo, you haven't got any age.
She's your understudy.
You'd have been proud of her.
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
That depends.
I mean really, deeply angry...
That's right, but I don't understand-
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
Well...
I said I'm a dying man!
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
Carl?
Who's first?
It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.
Sure.
'68.
--there had to be a White House overseer--
--we gotta top the Times--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names.
What's the matter?
I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury. 
Woodward?
What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
What does it say?
--according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971--
--what time is it?
They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
Down to Miami and back--how much damage can I do?
Absolutely--
Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
Anyplace really public, they'd know about it--they know everything at the Committee, Carl--
You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse?
One minute but then--
Gordon Liddy, you mean?
It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
To cover up?
But they both worked at the White House?
It will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time.
--I saw him. He verifies.
Look, I told you inside--
You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?
--this should take only a minute, Mr. Dahlberg, but we're doing a follow- up on the break-in--  --and I was kind of curious about your check.
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
To where?
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
You'll have to find that out, won't you.
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
Talk about Segretti--
There were more then.
--I know, I know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post--
Your name, please.
It may never come out.
--nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman. Just below him are a trio: Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend, and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr. Mitchell we've already discussed. Mr. Colson is the President's special counsel.
So?
--listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it--
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
Good work, Ostreicher.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
Hey, what're you doing here?
You can call me Ostreicher.
What?  No I'm not.
You want onions?
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
Hmm.  You know that's  really a shitty middle name!
He likes it.
...I've never tried it.
What?
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Fuck me!  Yes!
And you said...
At least now I know what the hell they're saying.
Gotta go.
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
Hey, where's Finch?
You can send me the address too.
No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
Can I come in?
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
Yes.  Seriously.
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
Who cares?
Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
You did it.
No...you...go...ahead.
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
Ho-lee shit.
That's my trick!
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
Yeah.
And little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed I ri-hide --
Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.
What reputation?
Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
...Guess what?
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?
<u>Yeah</u>!
Geez, I feel bad for him. Maybe we should've told him abou -
Just like sex with my wife.
Ha ha. You were probably right about his mom.
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
What happened? Did you cut yourself?
What does it say?
Whoa...
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
Okay. Be careful.
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
Claude...?
Nothing's happening!
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
Uncle Terrence?
Andy? Andy is that you?
Uncle Terrence, you're...
Claude.
He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better.  This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues...
Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
Not that I know.
Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
Andy!
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
No! I look ridiculous!
Don't let me go!
Don't you, child?
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
I've spent my whole life waiting to find you ...
Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
What was that?
It's her.
Wake up, young lady, that's our train.
You gave the orders!
Fellas... you know-Jesus! Come on!
I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
It's an important issue.
Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
Well, then, w-who was?
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
Well, no... not just, not only.
You have a car?  So...  I don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?
Me? Oh, downtown!
All right.
Oh, you do?
You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
Oh, you see an analyst?
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
Sylvia Plath.
M'hm...
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
Really, do you think so, really?
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
Okay?
We can digest our-
Yeah.
Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
M'hm.
Yeah.
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
Mine.
I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? 
Yes, it is.
It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
No, don't be silly. What-what do we need other people for?  You know, we should-we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or something.
M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
Yeah.
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
Yeah?
G-go on, I'm interested.
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-
Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-
-me, my God, it's a great day!
Remember, we had that thing.
yes, we had, uh...
What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
I'm into garbage. It's my thing.
Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?  Now, there was a model boy!
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
Don't get upset!
I can think of another word.
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm.
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
Don't give me your life story  just pick up the license.
Right, Max. California, Max.
Forget it, Max.
Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.
I have some very good memories there.
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.
Dennis-right, uh, uh... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night.
Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you.
Oh.
Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets.
Uh... w-we're going back to the Pierre. We're staying at the Pierre... and we're gonna meet Jack and Angelica, and have a drink there, and... if you'd like to come, uh, we'd love to have you.
It was a wonderful set.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
Jack.  Did you compose that yourself?
She's a constant surprise.
No, what?
And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script.  She can barely get the lines out.  There was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take.  I know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You know, that thing that was Sally - that always surprised you.  It's gone.  I think she's scared.  And that's death.
Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
Honey?
Oh.
It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours.  You know it could be disaster.  He's so allergic.  It's terrifying.
I'd love a Xanex.  Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding.
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
He's gonna miss his flight.
And you're not the wife.
It's not a contest.
Directing suits you.
When does he graduate high school?
Lucy overdosed.
We live next door.
Cal, my wife Judy.
Let me heal you, baby.
Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
I don't think so.
We'll be fine.
Take your time, Jer.
Happy anniversary, baby.
No.  Did you?
I think we should all take it tonight. Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving. That's the rule.  I love you Sally-Mae. You're going to have a fabulous time.
Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this.
That is not true.
It's a novel.
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
Sally, for Christ's sake.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
Ah.
No.  No.  Let me tell you something.  Directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood.  The sleep depravation alone.
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
And Ryan works at home.
I've never done this before.
What am I, five?
That's a lot of those.
You must have been a baby.
I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
Sorry?
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
Well, yes, actually.
You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water.
Are you making an ass of yourself?
Ready to go?
Ryan!
The Shostakovich.
Very.
Will champagne help?
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
No.  No, not like the last time.  She was the rest of my life.
It's our anniversary, Panes.
I didn't hear me say tonight.
I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
Happy anniversary.  Thank you for making me a part of it.
I trust you.
Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
Divinely?
No...as a matter of fact...
What <u>was</u> that thing?
I -- <u>hate</u> -- you.
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me?
Want a list?
Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess...
Yes?
Why do they have you tied up here?
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
Lays it on a little thick, doesn't he?  If you ask me, he's one giant bore.
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
Ask me why we're so successful.
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
You're a real buddy.
What do I do?
I'm getting lonely.  Who are you talking to, anyway?
I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
All right -- I'll tell him.  Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Care to make a small wager?
Oh, I never catch colds.
Why?
Twenty-seven.
Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
Sure.
Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
Oh.
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
He doesn't give a damn about me.
Yes, I've got it.  Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
A cemetery?
Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.
Why not?
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
No, I don't.
Where?
Here.
That's terrible.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
I love you, Miss Kubelik.
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.
Yes, sir.
Would you mind repeating the question?
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
This?
That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
Not that I have anything to hide.
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
Hello? -- yes -- what's on your mind, Baxter?
You're not making sense, Baxter. What's this all about?
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
Very clever.
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
What's gotten into you, Baxter?
Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?
I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
What are you going to do, Doc?
Want to tell me what happened?
Just as long as she's okay.
Why do you want to know, Doc? You don't have to report this, do you?
It's regulations.
A mansch -- a human being! So you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --
What's this -- you packing?
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
No, thanks -- I don't feel like it. Look, Doc -- in case I don't see you again -- how much do I owe you for taking care of that girl?
That so.
That guy really must've belted him.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
What's with you, Fran -- did you forget where you live?
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
You're not being funny.
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
What do you think?
And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
I know it's a drag -- but you can't find a hotel room in town -- not on New Year's Eve.
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
Baxter?
Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
Did you have a nice Christmas?
Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
See if they'll what?
I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
I like all of them --
No.
I was an FO for the 25th.
A sauciere --
What are you doing out here?
What do you see?
Not a thing.
You forgot the mangoes, didn't you?
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?
Can't be any worse than this. What do you think?
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
What does that mean ?
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
Do me a favor buddy, please.
What -- happened here.
How did they know?
No, sir.
About what ?
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.
Good swell.
Boss left.
He musta changed !  I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.
Music?
I'm waiting for the fucking boat, Colonel.
Do you know me?
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
What are you doing?
What's that?
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
You're Australian?
I should be checking on the boat.
Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages?
What show ?
That's 27, sir.
Where's your chief supply officer?
Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be?
Hard to work up an interest in politics, way we live.  You're the first people we've seen in two weeks.
117  CONTINUED:

How did she..?
What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam Wilder?  I heard he was in the middle of this mess.
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
That's not what I meant.
Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four days!  I thought you were dead, or worse.
You're hurt.
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
You don't feel cold?
I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner.
What do you know about people? You live like an animal!  A savage goddamn throwback like you belongs out here, as far away from the rest of us as possible.
They think you're in Fairbanks. If not, they still won't find you before the plane comes tomorrow.
You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.
Snow's to their advantage, kid. You can't see them, but soon as that plane comes, they'll sure as hell know where we're going. Wise up.  Take me to the Yukon. I'll give you that money and guarantee you'll walk away.
Can you walk?
Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
Pretty clever:  If the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time, Sam's is the first place they'll look.  They may figure you're waiting for an airplane, so you can't stay in the shack by the airstrip.  Last place they'd expect you is on the far side of town.  I can't afford any trouble --
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
Alleged killer.
Bet you're right.  But I didn't come by to wangle a meal --
Hey, Sam, look over there.  Black and white smoke.
Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
I called the cops in Fairbanks, see when Ben is standing trial. They don't know shit about Ben or Wilder!
Go easy.
Okay, let's backtrack, try to pick up his trail.  You know the kid out on the pipeline that Wilder's buddies with?
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
Hi...  Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?
Yes.
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
His name?
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today?
Getting loud, getting loud.
No... no thank you notes.
Nice of you... thank you.
Thank you.
No, sir...
What's that got to do with it?
Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
Are you still coming?
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
Nonsense!
Stop asking everyone.
No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
Fries.
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."
Sex with Simon?
I'll never forget you said it.
I don't want to hear that music right now.
Hello.
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
What do you want, Melvin?
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket.
Sure thing.
My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like?
If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.
Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
Did you like it that much?
Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
What?
What are you doing?
Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus fucking Christ!
After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information.  It bothered you, but you didn't care.  How do I know this?  Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.
That's right.
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
You would be.
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
Why don't you tell me.
I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.
Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.
I bet you fucking know!
Get on the expressway.
Nikita?  She helped me find you.
Yeah.
Okay.  How did you find me?
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
Forget it!
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
Just Electra?
No.
It looks like white's game.
He was... taken.
Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
How did you get into the business?
More or less.
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
Why did you leave the Agency?
My first take?
Yes.
About?
I don't know.
It helps me to focus.  It centers me, helps me think.
What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
Sorry.
Where did you learn it?
He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.
Sounds pretty well figured out.
Yes.
I think I got one today.
What?
I know.  It makes me crazy.
Did he explain how this happened?
What?
Are you attracted to me?
Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
Is this becoming complicated?
No.
Shit.
Right.
Electra --
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?
That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
Hey, do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.
It's possible.
You're pretty famous aren't you?
I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway?
Don't know.  That's how it works.
You mean quit?
Yeah.
You wish to close this account today?
It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
How to make a buck!
Sorry Katka, but I'm with Doug on this.
Fifteen crowns.
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
Chris, what if I were to cut you in as partner in this project - together we could make it swing, all it needs is a good clean out and the power on, then we're in business.
He was an electrician?
Not bad hey, I think I'll add Sparkie to my resume.....Good shovel!
I thought that was part of the charm!
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
I've been saying that since we met.
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
Destroy the evidence huh.
Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
Close!
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
Why don't we just take the whole damn building, brick by brick Doug.
No, not yet.
Get me a couple of beers and a salami.
What happened to Katka?
You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone I know?
Did you see anything in the files?
Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.
Siberia.
Yeah, no problem.
You don't understand, I can't!
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
Hey, Lawrence how are you doing mate?
So why don't you get up and speak something, then we will see who is crazy.
Doug you said you wouldn't be long. Come on, I've got to go. Now!
Let's walk over the bridge, we haven't done that for a while.
Kat, I'm in paradise. I don't ever want to leave.
There's nothing there for me.
I'll do my best. Is the place open.
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
Yes, it's looks good.....We will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. The others will just be house lights.
Okay?
Henry, these guys already push most of the drugs in this town and now they want to move into pornography, right? Believe me, it won't stop there either, next it'll be a church and pretty soon they'll have their own department store or something...... Henry, we've got to stop them. The foundation's got to put an end to it!
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
You mean it's started?
How do I know what's being said?
Alright, go help Chris shovel up the last of the crap.
I'd better get going, do you need a hand to get into bed?
Central station, locker number 139 - combination JFK.
Hey Doug, where you been?
Great, let's break for lunch and I'll buy you a beer on the way.
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
What are you an idiot!
I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.
And what of these foreigners?
You saw him?
After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.
You do. You're handsome and charming.
Deranged.
She's like some Puritan.
Landon!
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
I'm very sorry --
Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
-- Your act only works with an audience.
No problem --
Because I try to be nice to people?
The world of the dead?
Saturn. Beautiful.
Looking for intelligent life?
No.
You were great the other night.
Like fire.
The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
Mars.
You planned this --
Can you locate XXI5639I?
Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power.
That what you do?
You're worried about your college applications.
You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ?
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm so sorry. I'm a coward --
Will you do something for me?
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
I'm supposed to always be alone?
Boys like him have -- expectations.
I'm asking how much.
I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God!  I don't even know where to put all my anger.
How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
I've almost finished the rocker. Did she order mirrors?
When do I get time for me?
I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll?
How was school today?
Huh?
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
What time does school start around here?
Eileen, Chinese food again?
Huh?
But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
Maybe if I used my left....
Operator, what's today's date?
The power of a million hydrogen bombs!  ...and we get twenty four measly volts. It's not fair! I've been working on this power converter since 1949, and you'd think in all that time, I could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert radiation into electric energy! But no! Thirty three years of dedication and research, and all I've got to show for it is a bootleg video operation!
No, Marty. Shemp's molecular structure is completely intact!
Exactly two minutes difference...  and it's still ticking!
All I know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money.
Professor, you time machine works! It works! It sent me back in time! I'm from 1982!
A mall?
Pardon me?
The power converter...
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
Where did you get this?
My guess is that she turned him down.
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
That's all taken care of.
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
Pretty, isn't it?
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
Suzy!
Gone?... Where?
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
Catch!
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
They're okay.
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
Holly's over here, Kit, if you want to see her.
Sure is pretty.
I've got to stick by Kit... He feels trapped.
No.
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
It's okay.
That's my father. I got to run.
What?
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
But it would hurt.
You said that once already... Too late now.
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
That's Montana over there.
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Yes?
Fine.
You're my friend, aren't you?
See, we're about out... been driving all night. Actually, I don't even have time to explain it to you.
Just gimme a chance.
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
Smells fermented.  Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.
Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.
What crate?
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
You keep an eye on it.
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
Stay here, I'll be back.
Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno.
Why me?
Any sign of Buckaroo?
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
How about you? Will you be alright?
Please, Barton.
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
...Who is this?
If you could, I'd –
Yes, I'm afraid I have.
So now I'm s'posed to roll over like an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly scratched.
I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks – well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrational–
...No. I never saw him with anyone else.
It's still a little early for me.
I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland – I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
Well, I'm... glad to hear that –
And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
Doesn't surprise me at all.
That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.
Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by just being yourself.
Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself –
...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration –
Yeah, but –
In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact – New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
What do you mean?
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
Hold on –
You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on – just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
To be honest, I don't go to the pictures much, Mr. Lipnik –
...Yes, thank you.
Mr. Lipnik, I –
Transient or resident?
You want my partner to kiss your ass?
Physician, heal thyself.
Yeah.
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
How about the booze?
How's not smoking?
Yes.
You did it for me.
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
How long were you dating him?
Did you leave the club with him?
No.  We had a drink at the club. We left together.  I came here. He went home.
Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
I didn't.
I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.
I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you.  I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she?
No?
Can I talk to you a minute?
How'd you get in here?
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
No thanks.
I'm writing a book.
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
In the beginning.  Then I got to like what he did for me.
He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic.  Somebody drove by and shot him.
.38 revolver.  Never recovered.
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
The usual -- a girlfriend.
He had a girlfriend?
Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
I don't think it's funny.
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes.  There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened.
What do you want?
Keep your three o'clock.
Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
Is this finished yet?
Not sure. How was yours?
Let's get out of here.
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
It's in New Jersey.
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you."
After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to give up painting and start playing music again. I wanna sing.
Aren't they?
I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio?
Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.
MOTHAFUCKAH!
Do you think I could borrow your limousine? I'll get it back to you in an hour.
I'm here.
What are they?
Not black.
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called – hmmm...  – yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
Are those the only two possibilities?  You wanna French fry?
You want me to put it here?
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
Who's that?
You got a date already?
Oh man! Folklore guy – worked on the railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says "Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike.  Got a cigarette?
I don't really have any problems.
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
Do you know what he's saying?
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
It's Monday morning.
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee –
It looks done.
That is amazing. What year is it?
Is that the best quality you have?
Hi.
I don't eat junk food.
That one's for you.
I'll make you another one.
'Phillips head,' right?
I didn't know.
I need this?
Mr. Wayne ... Something wrong?
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
How could you?  I'm a woman...
Hey stud:  I thought we had something together.
Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us --
You're not coming to that, are you?  "The Relighting of the Tree" thing?
I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
If my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning.
You killed me, Batman killed me, Penguin killed me.  Three lives down.  Got enough bullets to finish me off?
Y'mean frame him?
Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
I got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here.  It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ...
And a very, very good one.
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
Alfred, am I pigheaded?  Is it always my way or the highway?
What is it?
Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
... A giant drilling truck burrowing under the city ...
She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
I see you knew him.
Physical perfection, charm and wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster. How do you explain your behavior?
No!?
Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand.
Dr. Isley.  it was like I could feel you in the room.  You're...enchanting. Gorgeous.  The most beautiful woman I've ever seen.  If you're..um... free...this evening.
Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.
Well...um...her.
That's gotta hurt.
Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
Her name is Pamela Isley.  I saw her talking to Gordon.  She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter has come at last.
I find that unlikely.
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
Our work?
She has an excellent mind.
...The night Batman was born.  What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.
Maybe they're right.
Why do I keep doing this?
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
What do maniacs always want?
Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
Rinka.
My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.
No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.
Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How about coming along?
Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
The style of the letters I'm getting matches those found at the crime sites. Why would The Riddler be sending me riddles?  Who's your decorator? U-Haul?
Find anything interesting?
Why do you do that?
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
My parents are laid out in the library. Their skin smells like talcum powder. I'm so small. My father's diary is on his desk like always. I'm opening the book. Reading. I'm running out into the storm. The book is in my hands. I can't hear my screams over the rain. I'm falling...
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
Okay. I'm outta here.
Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back.
Back off, man.
How about Richard Grayson, college student?
Chase?
I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne. His project was terminated this morning...
...You gonna kill me?
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
A man with a death wish.
How high up would you say that is?
Take me. Let the boy go.
Can't we --
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
Odd desire for anyone.
I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.
All street mimes should be executed.
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
Ohhhh... You don't mean that.
And what happens if we say no?
Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist.  People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
Not what?
HOLY SHIT!!
Ali?  What's wrong?
Okay.  It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the gallery ...
David, I'm serious!
I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days.
Hi,
Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
Yes, isn't he.
Everything okay, David?
Ah, David.  Finally.  And this must be our professor from across the sea.
I owe you a very serious apology, young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not.
Welsh.
Welsh again.
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right?
Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about ....  oh, 20 minutes.
... in the distant future.
NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
Nope.
What's gone?
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
Huh huh. This says Beavis.
Huh huh huh. That chick was talking about doing it.
This is dumb, let's find that chick.
Check it out Butt-Head, TV!
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
C'mon, Beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
Hey Butt-Head it's that chick!
Huh huh huh. Settle down Beavis.
Um... ass... head...
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
Talk ta me, Bork.
That's better. Yes?
Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.
What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
Okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill!
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it.
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
She's ready.
I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
You saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something.
Two hours.
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
That little girl saw us.
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
... Not what I expected when we walked through that door.
God, this is so corny.  Have we been reduced to this?  Sheets?
Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
Of course I did.
Go ahead... third time's a charm.
Honey.  Let's go.
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
Little black party dresses?
What...?
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life!
Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
Did you get the paint?
Yes... or no?  Do you want the Deetzes out or in?
All right.  Who are you?
Just one daughter.
Folks, be reasonable here.  I'm at your service.  You be the judge. I'm a harmless guy.  Try me.
We're very unhappy.
I want to be dead too.
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.
Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway, this can wait.  We'll get a crowbar later.  Your mother...
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
Are they suffering?
Any particular kind?
All right, you dead people!  Come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with!
What do you think?
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
Maybe Charles does.
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
Are they still here, Otho?
It's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone.
Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?
I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full...  ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably...  ... Any pain here?
He does, does he?
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
Stay here? Is that necessary?
... But he's...?
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.
Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before.
He does...?
... Good night, Chauncey.
Chauncey...
Thank you, Eve.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
No, thank you.
I see.
Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
I know...  ... So are you, Chauncey ...  ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
No. I'm not busy.
Can you see well?
Yes, I do, it's very good.
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
Yes, it is very good!
Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
No, Ben.
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
Oh, I see.
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books.
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
Some pictures...?
How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes?
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.
... Yes. You can take me.
... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ...  ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you...
You're welcome.
Yes... Of course, you know, Mr. Gardiner, that I always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests, I hope you don't object to that.
No. I don't object.
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
I live here.
Have you served in the Army?
I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
Yes, I will.
Yes. I will.
... Sid, be reasonable - I've been everywhere, there's no place left to check!
Try again.
Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
Yes, ma'am.
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
... Yeah...
... Business, bullshit! Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar...
Right, Chief.
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
Oh? What?
That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.
Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
You take care too, Bobby.
Okay.
Malkovich.
Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.  Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?
I'm sorry. How was your evening?
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
Why?
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
No they're not.
Suck my dick!
It'll never happen, fuckface.
You fell in love with her first.
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
I'm sorry for everything.
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
I know.
Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?
Mr. Juarez?
Yes?
Yex?
You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.
Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see.  Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
Why not?
That's the usual?
I’m not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male.
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
I've fallen in love.
You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
No.
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
No. Don't be an ass.
Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
Anybody else?
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
Yeah, I saw them
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
Mr. Malkovich?
Can I get you a drink?
I can explain about the portal, darling.
I'm getting better all the time.
Vegas.
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
Captain Mertin?
This Saturday - you coming to Call or what?
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?
She gone like they say?
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
Fine. But what would I do at night?
In case of what?
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
Extra?
MAMA!
I know what I see.
The church!
It's her, ain't it?
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
Aw, no, Ella.
Just me.
You planning to do anything about it?
Yes sir.
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.
We've had some terrible news.  Mr. Lebowski is in seclusion in the West Wing.
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
They called about eighty minutes ago.  They want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only or I'd go with you. They were very clear on that: one person only.  What happened to your jaw?
That guy treats women like objects, man.
Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
Can we just rent it from you?
Sir, please lower your voice--
Sheesh.
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
I'm shomer shabbas.
Who has your undies, Walter?
What have you.  We'll, uh--
And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity.
Wonderful woman.  We were very--
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
No.  Here.
Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
Take it easy, Dude.
Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
Hello, gentlemen.  You are the bereaved?
"Johnson"?
Huh?
I was talking about my rug.
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
Shit yeah, the achievers.
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
She most certainly was not!
I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence--
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
Delayed after-eff--
Uh-huh.
We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
Forget it, Donny.  You're out of your element.
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
Am I wrong!
Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.
What the fuck are you--
Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck herself.  Why can't she board it?
You mean--beyond pacifism?
No, you're not wrong--
Okay then.  We play Quintana and O'Brien next week.  They'll be pushovers.
Huh?
That...fucking...bitch!
It's your roll--
The fucking point is--
Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!
You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked!
"Our" car, Walter?
That wasn't her toe.
The nail polish, Walter.
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
What about the toe?
I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.
No, I'm--
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
Uh-huh.
The bulk of the series.
You're going to enter a world of pain, son.  We know that this is your homework.  We know you stole a car--
Walter, if you're there, pick up the fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, this is an emergency.  I'm not--
Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency.
I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.
Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
Huh?
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
You know this!
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
He can't walk, Walter!
Yeah.
Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him.
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
It's a heart attack.
Call the medics, Dude.
Wha. . . Donny--
Walter Sobchak.
Well can we--
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
Well we--I don't--
Who the hell is he?
Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
I'm not--
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
This is our world you're entering.  You may see things -- feeding.  Just remember why you're here.
What was that?
It means "bloodbrother."
He's right.  They'll smell that you're human.  Stay here, watch our backs.
Where were you, Whistler?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Your security's for shit, kid.
It has been said, you may have enemies whom you hate, but not enemies whom you despise.  Be proud of your enemy: then his success shall be yours, too.  In that regard, I should thank you.
His name is Jared Nomak.
They've made contact with the Reapers.
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
Guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought.
Who is LaMagra?
Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst.
Why?
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
And that's a good thing?
You care about him, don't you?
How long have we been driving?
I know. Take some of my blood.
This isn't human blood.
Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
Whistler!
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
Trying to find the energy.
The bitched-out babe in back here is one Anna Tassio--we met one dark and stormy night in a Blair Witch chat room, we all did--
Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired.
--chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents. It's called vandalism.
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
You feel no need to get married or anything.
This is a goddamn disaster. Let's just pack it up and go.
I want to see something!
Are you marked like this??
I know, I know.
<u>This</u> is what you wanted enhanced?
You have to go.
You want a hand?
So, I hear you're from New Mexico!
My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
I take it back--she <u>wasn't</u> an actor. She's a nutjob.
Nice tent.
Get inside quick, they'll stop.
English.
Where?
--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
Who?
--turn the camera off--
--a Wiccan--
We're not making Blair Witch II here.
Was it <u>every</u> day or just semi- weekly you got your ass kicked as a kid?
That's almost a year's worth of work!  Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus....
What's that?
For a blur?
What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
What're you afraid's going to happen?
--I know!
--or Lyme Disease or poison sumac, or God knows what-else we could have picked up in the woods.
Could I tell him what it's regarding?
--the Sheriff's Office--
No, I--
...Drive me to a motel?
See a guy.
Well... the couch would be all right...
I could've sworn I heard something.
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal.
...Huh?
Yeah? What happened?
Uh-huh.
Abby... you all right?
Ray?... What time is it?
What happened?--Was Meurice there?
I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.
...Who?
...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found--
...Friday?
No.
Then what'd you come here for?
How long did you watch her?
...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love--
You want me to kill 'em.
Has Ray come in yet?
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Frank. Come in.
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
You did? A human ear?
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Come into the study a minute.
Okay.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
For now. Alright. you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.
Frank?
Yes, but.
Frank. he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. come on. He didn't mean it.
Oh he forced you, huh?
The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word.
Well.
I made it go down the toilet.
Oh shit.
No.
Yes. Frank-
I want you to hurt me.
You like to open me. don't you?
Why are you here?  Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.
Where have you been?  Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
They hurt his head.
Who, Dorothy?
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
What are you lookin' at?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
Yeah. What are you doing now?
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
Here's to. an interesting experience.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
What did you see?
You want a Dairy Queen?
Yeah?
That's what I thought.
I don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the night I met you.  . in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess. until the robins come there is trouble.
Goodnight.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.
You like mysteries that much?
It's okay.
NO.
You want to dance?
Probably not. no. Why?
How ya doin' Dad?
I'm going out for awhile.
Yeah, I know.
That sounds great!
Come on out a minute, okay?
The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Nothing like this back home.
You happy, baby?
Should we buy it?
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?
Nice doing business with you, George.
If you don't mind me asking, what is the reason you are in this place?
Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?
Murder.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
Good night.
I would if I could get some sleep.
No, my brother.
And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
What type of planes do you have?
Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
Diego?  It's George.
Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you.
Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
Good to see you, Diego.
Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
You're a lucky man, Diego.
Three years.  How long have we been in business?  Three years.  Does she get to meet your connection?  Was she good enough?
Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't telling you.  It's just business.  Now, shut up.  You're driving me crazy.
Take it easy!  Everything's okay!
No more brothers, Diego.
He's in tachycardia.  George, your heart is racing.  Have you been using drugs?
Well, you know.  It's um...
So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
Diego?
Yeah.
I didn't come here to drink scotch.
I see.  I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus is.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
Just low.
You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
Dad.
You're not going to trial?
Money.  You and your mother.  All the time chasing it.  I never understood it.
Figured it out.
Figured what out?
George.
Look what the cat dragged in.
Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.
But this is...
What are we going to do?!  What are we going to use for money?!
My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.
What do you want?
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
Yeah.
You can call me Dad if you want.
Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
Holy shit, Dulli!
Are we good?
What's happened to you?
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
And how many are we?
Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
No ...
Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...
It could've happened to anyone.
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
No.
Is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand?
-- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
What was the nature of the argument?
That's it.  My client doesn't have to take this crap from you.
Sit down, Frank.
C'mon -- think about it.  If she was going to kill Marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find?
I'm just curious to see if Mr. Troxell reconstructed anything else.
A little after eleven.
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
Mr. Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson?
What happened next?
And how are you now?
Why do you think she left you?
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
Can you give the court an example?
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
Did you ever see her again after that?
Did you suggest any?
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
Don't you see what she's doing?  She needs you to kill me.  She's planned it that way from the start.  That's why she phoned me tonight.
Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's condition?
No.
Then you have no way of knowing what Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?
Oriental medicine.
Did you go to college, Mrs. Crawford?
No.
Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan Paley?
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
Yes -- he did.
He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
You don't really believe what the district attorney is saying about Miss Lawson, do you?
How do you know what kind of sex they had?
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
He video taped you.
In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out.  Why do you think he did that?
Well - I'm a little confused.  This is a charge receipt from Rosen's Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an account.  It's dated the day of the murder.  Is this your signature?
Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
What do you have in your purse?
Yes.
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
I thought the subject was sex?
When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road.  I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries.  It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes.  The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down.
We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.
Is it against the law?
What do you think?
What would?
Is that what you think I was thinking?
You lied to me!
Something wrong?
You killed him -- didn't you?
I'm dropping the case.
No -- he's lying.
How's it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me.  After that I figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in.  That you were crazed because we humiliated you in court?
Michael -- get off the phone.
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
Yes.
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
No.
Yes.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
We were here two Christmases ago.
Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
I thought everything WAS arranged.
Michael.
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
He's getting her drunk. That's what happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That's why she couldn't tell us.
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
I never knew that.
Nobody did.
Not this kind of heat.
Roseman Bridge?
No.
After the divorce.
Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
Are you by nature a sadistic person?
Looking for something in particular? There's not much of a selection.
Want another cigarette?
I feel so embarrassed.
No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
You've got it all right here, you know. It's just as beautiful as any other place I've seen. God, it knocks me out.
Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?
Do you ever regret not having a family?
I told you, I love other people.
But no one in particular.
No. I was just... No.
I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage.  Francesca, the last thing I want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it's just -- I mean, it's nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or... 
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
What are you doing?
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!?
Are you seeing Betty tonight?
Okay.
Apparently just before her death.
Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
Well, close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
'S up?
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
But that's your old hood, Pops.
Wh-wh-whooo?
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
I don't understand it.  You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas.  I always looked after you.  You had a piece of everything I had.
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
Careful.  That's bad luck.
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
Bill!  Bill?!
We gotta jump!
You got the cash?
Where is it?
What are we doing down here?
You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
You were just a kid.
What building?
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
Shit, that was fast.
That's all we did, steal their ride.
It was just like in my head.
That building?
That's right, I know.  I fucking know.
You don't think I'll do it, do you?
Where's what?
Sit down, Gino!
Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?
But you know he did it.
No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.
See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!
You can't leave.
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic bags ...  tape and rope ...
I saved you.
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.
Caesar, didn't I tell you to get something?
Yeah?
Yeah, Mick.  I've got the money. I'm staring right at it.
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
Hello?
Yeah.
Truck.
I knew it.
Do you know him?
Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
I'm not afraid of anything.
I don't understand - ?
What about that guy this morning?
He was in love with you, right?
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
There is no going back.
What if he doesn't run?
Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!
I don't know what we're talking about.
You're asking me a direct question?
She's a gypsy.  If it's a cover, it's a great one.
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
No.  We can't risk it.
...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  Treadstone had those pills...
Bonjour?  Monsieur?  Allo...
Right.  Yes.  Of course.
Yes.
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
We're about an hour away.
Where?
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
No.
I trusted you.
I found it.  It took six calls.  I found Kane.  I found the body.
-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
This your store?
Yes.
I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
Shit, we didn't sign in.
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
What?
Sir...
-- let's check that Interpol window again --
-- and they're sure it's him? --
What the fuck is he doing?
What?
<u>Where am I</u>?
It came from your hip.  Under the skin.  You have a bank in Zurich.  You remember Zurich?
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
Tuttle! ... mumble!  You've had that scab Tuttle here, haven't you?
Sign the form so we can get to it.
What? You mean you've got ...
It's reply paid.
You don't have to sing it.
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -
In fact, killing people -
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
Yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it seems she was killed resisting arrest.
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
Ah ...
Enough though, eh?
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
Christ! You do know it all!
So how ...?
Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
And you're mine.
You're the only person I can trust.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
Yes we have, Jack!
How could you do this to me?
But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now?
If you say so.
No.
Where are you taking me?
OK. What's in the parcel?
What are you doing in Information Retrieval?
They'll be there waiting.
Get away!
You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
Where are you going?
Oh my God, a mistake!
It's what you wanted isn't it?
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
Lime, I need to use your computer
Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.
I just wish you would stop interfering, mother! I don't want promotion. I'm happy where I am.
What is it?
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
What have you done with his body?
Er, yes ...
It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.
My I.D. cards.
Monsieur. Quel numero.
what? ... Oh ... 
Now look what you've done to him.
But we can get one.
What is it?
The pace?
He looks like a cop.
You're going to live.
What about Kanita?
That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank?
You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.
Noel, you didn't let me finish. We have rules against killing people on the street. Looks bad, but there's a special room at the hospital for terminating. A nice quiet room with a big bed.
He's dead, huh?
I think this place stinks.
No.
Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
I need to sit down a minute.
OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said--it was just because I was stoned. Forget it.
My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?
Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first.
Backup?
Don't give me that look.
I hate vodka.
The family know?
Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives.
The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it.  You can do that for me at least.  Three Zebra.
Shit, shit, shit...
Keep it to yourself.
Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
This story they won't cover.  And if the network doesn't cover it -- it must not be important so why worry.
It's Mr. Buddy Felton?
That's your full name?
Okay.  Let's do me.
Nine seconds.
Did you shoot their boots?
We can cut back at the end.
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything.  When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.
Did you bring your grey suit?
Define your terms.
How?
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...  ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
Oh, I was just writing you a note. What do you say we take a walk?
Aaron, I've never seen them like this -- I think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to...
Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot... Fuckee.  You want to use that?
All this business of war -- do you get scared?
I was a little nervous there for a minute.
No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.
You don't have time.  Not a chance.
What did he say?
Yeah, I know, I went back and forth on it.
Tell George and Jessica to try and cover everything without Tom having to ask additional questions.
Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
They're not really going to call security are they?
No, I don't think so.
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source.
Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
I don't know.
As long as that's your only problem you're...
Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him.  Not near ready.  Not by the longest shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story.  I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.
Uh-huh.
Hi.
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
What do you mean clean?
Yeah?
Well, what is it?
It's not important.
No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
Uh-huh.
Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
Well, why not?  Hey, what is this?  My life's rushing in front of my eyes.
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
I just need you for another minute now, so we can shoot from behind towards me, and, um...
A girl with a body like mine?
It's just an innocent question.  Besides I just wanted to clarify your intentions.
What the hell's going on?
I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...  It's very good, Walter -
Like it?  It's a masterpiece.  I've never seen anything like it before... and I hope I never see anything like it again. Walter smiles and looks at his creation -
Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!
What's up, Walter?
Did you hear what he said?
It's true, isn't it?
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
That's word for word.
I hope this was made with egg whites!
Why not?
What's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?
Look at that, man.  Big deal.
I know, man.
I wonder what his deal is.
Didn't you hear him?
No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
Dead Cat?
Yeah.
Well...
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
You better hold off on the bubbly.
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
I'm trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere...
I can't talk right now.
I also saw the girl give you this.
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
Are you done with these?
What do you get?
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
I was just straightening up the place.
The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?
No, we didn't.
I... feel.... pretty.
What'd you dream about?
Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
They were vampires, weren't they?
Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
Good thing one of us was prepared.
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
Bogutude.  Blow it off.
You were supposed to be here at three.
I forgot.
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
Excuse me for having something important to do.
Am I in trouble or something?
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
Where's the other one?
What, um...  What do we do?
All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
It was necessary.
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
Buffy...
I...
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
Football is my life.
No THX.
You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.
Cassandra's really smart.
Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
So very much.
No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
Hi, Grueller.
You think so?
Oh, yes!  Yes!
Buffy?
I got all the plastic stuff.  What should I do with it?
Except for Prom.
It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
Ah, you'll be coming back.
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
Yeah maybe you're right.
Mmm, hmmm.  You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off.  When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life.  He likes baseball more than I do...
A little better.
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
Just till I lose.
No, that's okay.  All I need's a little nap.
Fundamentals?
No!  You're playing with my mind!
I'd like you to meet my father.
I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
That's great!
You didn't get "lured".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
You're gorgeous, God damn it! From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you.  I had to have you!
And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
I got released.
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
Annie---
What's it say?
He's a good student.
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
You missed the tag!
You spit on me!
I didn't spit on you!
You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
Fastball.
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
I'm having a blast.  God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
Naw...
You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while I'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers.  She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for.
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
It's time you started working on your interviews.
"...Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
I'll take you back to the hotel.
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
Nuke--  Good luck.
Step outside, pal.
Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
She's playing with my mind.
No.
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust.
Goddamn, that's great!  Jesus!  Listen, Crash don't like anybody to know it but--  Most nights he goes down to, you know, down to Niggertown.  To Sandy's...  the whorehouse.
What?
That's right.
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?
Oh, good.
Hey!
But one thing I could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.
...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.
Right back.
Yeah, sure I do. Why?
I can't! I'm tied!
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -
Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?
' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit?
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
Hello.
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
All right.
You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
Listen, I would -
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
You never - ?
...uh, you know, I just wanted to talk to you a minute.
Yeah, she's here.
Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time.
Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it?
Hello.
I-I'm sorry, Sam.
You've got to stop her.
Legally, she can't take that stuff. Legally, she can't take the stuff.
...and she doesn't always -
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
Okay. Just take it easy.
She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money.
Any change?
I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.
Hi. Nice to see you.
I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
Huh?  Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat?
Okay.
Yes, I - yes, I do.
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
I should have -
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
Should I let her in like - ?
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, Rothstein followed several...
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without...
Okay, I'll -
Yeah, okay.
Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.
This is not the way to treat people.
A record of the arrests...
Can't do it with both hands?
So, you're a righty?
I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
Yeah.
Mm.
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
You gotta go back out there.
But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
Go back inside! This is none of your business!  I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore.
What do you want? It - It's pitch- black out here. It's tin foil.
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me.
He's not here?
Yeah, I'm over here with him.
Carmine? He was here before. I saw him. He had a suitcase and everything, and then he left.
Artie!
Calm down! Calm down!
Hey, Frankie.
...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?
It's in all the papers.
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? 
Mm.
Am I right?
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
Mm, you want to steal it? 
Thanks.
And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
What? What?
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
I did what you told me to.
No, he's not.
He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
Come on. Don't be scared.
Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
Great.
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
Right.
...they're in Penthouse K.
Well, how come I laid nine?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
She asleep?
Stacy. 
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
Take it easy!
No more fuckin' dirty work!
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
How you doin'?
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
Well, I'm a little confused here.
What's the matter with you?
Since when do you talk like that?
Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
All right, all right. But I - I -
Yeah.
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
Do I have to remind everyone that in two days, we'll all be dead. The Cult of Good will be a memory. I don't want to hear about lawsuits or cereals. We have a secret mission...
Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned...
I thought we were going to take it easy until the Mission...
I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
You say that like an amnesia victim.
What did you think?
Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
Tonight, somewhere in the city, innocent people will die--but then one of you knows that; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God.
Oh, how long have you had your own route?
She has a real spirit.
You're right, I wasn't looking to fall in love with a casino worker. I'd given up trying to find anyone. But there was a fire in your eyes that cut right through the air conditioning and through the coldness of my heart.
Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
Winning.
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
The "skylight?" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
I loved you.
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three?  You people were once heroes. You had ideals.  You fought for things.  Spooky told me so...
The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
You Housewives have no idea what we go through!
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..
You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...
A genuine woman of mystery in Oasisburg.  Amnesia. Bulletholes in exposed stomach badly concealed with body make-up.  Beautiful, intelligent eyes that have no business in "Frank's Fun Palace" or anybody else's Fun Palace for that matter..
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Nothing. How's your hand?
About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
I told you I should've cuffed him.
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
Make a "U" and go back.
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
Got your badge?
Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I.
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
You won't disconnect.
They tortured my husband.  Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
Who?
Oh man.  These people mean business.
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
Pictures.
Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.  Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
Does she wear glasses?
It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
The one in Brentwood.
Are you okay?
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
She's next.  In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
Now I have -- it's a long story.
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
Damned if I know.
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
Any idea where you're going?
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
What's really on your wicked little mind?
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
Naturally.
Know what else is in here?
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you.
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
Got a phone in that van?
Sure.
I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on.
Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
My pleasure --
You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
You researched me.  You know where I live.  She'll be waiting for you there along with your split.
Yeah?
In the hills above Sunset.  Just below the Getty.
Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together.
Better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them.
Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
I thought so.
The 405 is coming up.
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
She's not a girl, Col --
He gave me a look.
Yeah?
You see that, Col?
He's going to take his foot off slowly, David. Then you're to go home, like a good boy. You hear me?
She's not a tart.
Do it on your own time, Paddy.
How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum?
Someone recommend you?
No.
The accent, I suppose.
That should make her happy.
Who's she?
You all right?
You on the game?
Give me that look again.
What's that about?
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
He lived here with you?
He was different.
Yes...
What would he think?
Do you miss him?
I think you do.
He did sometimes.
Dil --
What you doing here?
I didn't mean to hit you.
Make it up to me, then.
Do they know?
Probably.
Kind of wish I didn't.
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
Don't ask me in.
No. Can't pretend that much.
She from Scotland too?
Do you like me even a little bit?
It's a secret.
Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me, too.
See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.
Stop it, Dil --
I like you, DIl
You do?
Say it again.
And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
Tell me what she wore.
Yes. Now.
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
He's hot.
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
And then you'll leave her out of it?
Dil!
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
Would make me feel better about it.
Should blow you away, you know that?
Definitely unusual.
Good. So what do you think?
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
Fuck you.
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
Do what?
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
She's a friend of mine
I got sent.
So when you come to shoot me, Paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler.
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
You liked her?
Want you to do something, Fergus.
Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
What you say, faster?
What if I did?
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
You didn't?
Have you no feelings, woman?
I think that's what you ordered.
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
Where's that airlines bag?
I love you, Adam.
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
You lied to me so many times --
What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
I said, tell me to go to the --
Reggie -- listen to me --
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss --  -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you?  Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.
Very sweet.
Then whose is it? His or theirs?
Why not?
Because they're still here.
He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
Yes -- ?
Are you sure there's no mistake?
Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?
No.
Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one.
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
How long do you intend -- ?
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
Carson Dyle is dead.
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
I met a man with sharp nails.
I left him hanging around the American Express.
Sure.
I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
Reggie -- listen to me --
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
Tuesday.
Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
Maybe.
I think Tex did it.
I'd love some, thanks.
I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
What's its value today?
And the last one?
The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
Please keep it.
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
But his mother --
You loved him?
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
I know.  I'm sorry.
One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elysées"  Why there?
Why, do you think we're going to?
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
Do you know what you're going to do?
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
Hallo, Peter.
Of course? I thought he was dead.
What was all that?
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
Who said?
How do you shave in there?
Go on.
I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
So they think he left it with you.
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
What are you talking about?
Don't put yourself out.
Yes?
No -- no, I'm don't.
Because I don't love him.
Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
What?
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
I never fucked Rod.
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
Good.
She's my daughter, Tom.
So?
I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
Ok.
No honey.
Are you sure?
What kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves, 'Think I'll nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?
No?
Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.
The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can eavesdrop too.
No! That's his table.
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
Does she fuck?
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
What?
I won't.
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
Don't you think it's sick?
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
Why?
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
What are you doing?
Yes?
I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
What?
Why not?
People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
Yes?
Hey! That was a 3k machine.
I said no.
Rod!
What, do you work for my boss, dog?
Damn.
A little early for a delivery.
Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
...and fair...
What did I say?
Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.
All right.
Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...
That dog was mean before I met him.
That's...
I ain't playin' that.

Kiss my ass!
...I'm not the psycho.
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.
...waiting!

...man!
...up!
...Pete!  Come on!  There it...

Oh, shit.
Come on, old Pete.
...wanna give it a try!
Shut up!
Oh, shit.  It's okay.  Okay. 
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.


What?



Uh-oh.
...stole the truck.
You know what I'm sayin'?
...truck.
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
...-er.  It was your friend...
...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
That is loud!  I'm 
...man.


Arlo!

 That's why I didn't give it...
Hang...
  I've got the real thing!
Okay...
Mason.

 Vitelli! Vitelli!
Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.
Okay.  Come on, big guy!
 Well.
We're the shit.  Bigtime.
You did help a little.
Who had to put a gun to your head?
Who put the big hurt on...
Hello.
That's bullshit.
You know, it's, uh-it's very hush-hush, as we say in the spy game.
It all started with our mission in Istanbul.
I was undercover as a tennis player.
Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
Hey.
That was quick.
...about him.
I urge you to be persuasive.
Vaughn.
Well, that just about figures for today.
Wait.  This town is full of trucks.  Nice new trucks.  You don't need to go...
So you called the damned thing Elvis
 ...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...

He's the dude...
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.
They were all wearing hardware.
Doc-...
...-bility.
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
 All right.  One more shot, provided...  we're off the island tonight.
No!
Is that why you're here?  To blame...
"Went away."  I like that.
Do you know what'll...
...-ians.  But I assure you, Leo...
Knowing you, Brynner, you've got buyers waiting to buy! You're not gonna use that...
All right.  Tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour.

Vaughn.
Yeah, he's wanted in connection with a death this morning at the Jerome...
 But...
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
...dangerous.
...deer.
Doc...
Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither...
...your concern nor your fight.  Relinquish the package and you can go.
...and ask a simple question -   Are you actually prepared...




Darlene, it's five-thirty.  Now, I worked late for you this mornin', and you didn't wanna spring for over-...
Oh.  Well, I have got to get to the dentist be-...
I can handle it.
Oh, caught a few, lost a few.
Hit it...
 ...that tunnel.
The sooner you get up the lab, the sooner you'll figure it out.
What the hell are you talkin' about...
Been trying to figure out your secret.
Yeah.  Ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  We use the same equipment, more or less...
He's brains without ambition...
Turn the power of the hunter against him.
 ...or it'll ignite. 
And what if it does?
Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly.
How much longer for the range and power projections?
Dr.  Long!
Got that?
You know, I gotta tell you.  That really bothers me, somebody calls me "son."
 Wait.  Listen to me, Pappas.  If you don't let us by...
  All right.

Gimme this god-...

'Course you do, Jake.
Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records.
It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
Yes, his girlfriend.
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
At my age, you tend to lose track...
My daughter.
What about her?
How did you find out?
That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
How do you do that?
I have no idea. How much do you want?
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
Sure thing.
Sure, as soon as we eat.
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
Okay.
Then what'll you do?
Well you own a lot of land.
How are you, Lou?
How'd you get past the guards?
Since when?
Or her name?
Isn't that your number?
Yeah?
You accusing me of extortion?
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
I know what he says.
Matter of fact I do.
Of course.
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
That's not his apartment.
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
I have?
I don't like the word 'cheat.'
Did he know?
I can't tell you.
You mean you don't know where you were?
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
Another satisfied client?
Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard.
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
We got it. We got it, baby.
What? What is it?
I'll stay.
Hold still. Why?
...A flaw...
It's possible.
The police?
Yes.
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
Upstairs. Why?
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no?
That's good. Now what's her name?
Katherine?... Katherine who?
Yeah... where are you taking her now?
Let me handle that.
Walsh here?
Oh no.
Yeah, Sophie.
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. These staff meetings, they just go on and on.
I don't understand.
Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. We're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. The city comes first, naturally.  But, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under. Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff.
I said, the northwest valley.
Well, no.
The water.
Yeah?... I do?
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
Of course not.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
Mr. Mulwray, please.
He's not in, Mr.?
He owned the water department?
Yes.
They were partners.
This?
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
You must be thinking of a different daughter.
She ran away?
That's for sure.
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!
No...
Will they really find work in Germany?
I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget...  So, Toto, how are these home movies going? 
You weren't expecting me?
But where'd you go, Toto?!!
You 're thinner...You can tell you've not been treated well. .
Thanks for all you've done for me.
What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of all times!
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
Hi, Elena!
No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father.
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
But I never saw that note!  I must have covered it with my hand, without realizing it, that's the only explanation... 
No...It's nothing to do with you. It's just that I was scared of coming back. Now, after all these years, I thought I was strong, that I had forgotten lots of things. Instead, I find it's quite the opposite, as if I had never left. And yet, I look at Lia and feel as if I didn't know her, and you, Mamma...I abandoned you, ran away like a thief, thought only of myself, and never gave you an explanation...
Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -
I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something?
He's a great guy - Leland.  Why'd he ever leave New York?
Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.
What's the matter?
Don't I always?  Most of the time?
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter, but here's what I mean.  There's a front page story in the "Chronicle,"  and a picture - of a woman in Brooklyn who is missing.  Probably murdered.  A Mrs. Harry Silverstone.  Why didn't the "Enquirer" have that this morning?
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
Emily!
Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie.  You haven't got any idea -
Charlie, please don't -
You've got some on your face.
You're no Venus de Milo.
Hey, you should be more careful. That's my ma and pa.
A chicken?
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
Well, I -
I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.
I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.
You see!  There hasn't been a true word -
I happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday, Charles.  Could I not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise -  this Enquirer - that is costing you one million dollars a year?
Raymond - 
Oh, yes, sir.
That's the second sentence you've started with "I" -
Brad, you are drunk.
Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten.
Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
Brief marriage!  Ten years! 
Or Rosebud?  How about it, Jerry?
What did you get?
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
Right away.  Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?
Well, if it's already too late...
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
That's it, everybody out.
Can I join in?
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
He was?
I was here the whole time.
So you're really getting married?
How like her.
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
I'm giving him his ring back.
Look how full of yourself you are.
But can we date?
You work in a market, all right.
I'm serious.
I can't believe this! I feel faint...
What time was this?
Are you open?
This is the last time I come to this place.
In a second!
Shit!
That's what I said.
What smells like shoe polish?
No, thanks.
You don't want to know.
Five years.
That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
Oh, my God.
They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
There's more?
A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.
It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade.
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
See? There you go again.
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
Helluva game!
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
You know what Sanford told me? 
Yeah, right.
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
You were saying?
That's embarrassing?
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
Balls resting on his lips.
If you must.
We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
So your argument is that title dictates behavior?
That's stretching it. You're not being asked to slay children or anything.
What the fuck did you do that for?
And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
Please, get the hell out of here.
Little girl. Maybe five years old?
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
There's no lights back there.
What? What's with you? You haven't said anything for like twenty minutes. What the hell is your problem?
As if it's that easy.
Leave me alone.
Make them change.
Thanks.
You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
Why do you say that?
To talk to you.
I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.
You need a ride?
Same time. What about you?
I'll call you. Let you know.
All right. Good luck with Veronica. If you want, I can talk to her, you know, and explain...
I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room.
I don't think so.
How do you know that?
What? When? When did all this shit happen?
Go open the video store.
Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!
With you? I don't think so.
What's that mean?
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
Veronica.
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
Oh... Can I help you?
Say, young fella, you know I hate to bother you again, but can I take a paper or something back there... to read?  It usually takes me a while, and I like to read while it's going on.
You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.
Hunhh? Nothing.
She called you, didn't she?
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
You're trusting.
Why do you say that?
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
I was kidding.
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
Like you said-she snowballed him.
That's because I never had sex with him!
How many dicks have you sucked?!
Something like thirty-six.
Lower your voice!
Um. Thirty-seven.
No, but you sucked enough dick!
Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
What is it?
Thank you for the lasagne.
Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.
It was only a few times...
A couple...?
Would you let me explain...
Usually I just turn the can upside down.
I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
What are you talking about?
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag!
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
Work!  Don't say that word, man.
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
Answer the man.
Hal's signalling he's OK.
He said the Tower, but he's on Comb Bluff?  Frank, fly me to the west valley, the winds are never too bad there and it's only a half hour climb to the Douglas Shaft.
You know how the airlines are.
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
She's losing it!
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
Take the gun.
Sarah, tonight why don't you and Hal come over for dinner?
Four...five...
Please -- oh, no -- please!
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
You're saying, I don't understand?  I'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand.  I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I <u>understand you</u>.
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
A flare up...
If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
For the same reason you did, to help.
What about you?
I'm glad you find humor in this.  Do you know what people would do for that?
A simple yes or no would have done.
She's a lyin' bitch!!
We were going together before I ever let go of you.
He'll freeze.
He asked you, how far?!  I think you've been taking the scenic route.  How far from here?
Right.
Don't give him anything.
He's alive!
What's the code, Travers?
You got what we need?
No names, this is an open line!
A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
He are here! He have arrived! Hooray!
Sorry about the pain. Using the gulliver to much like, eh? Giving orders and disciplining and that perhaps, eh? You sure the pain's gone? You sure you'll not be happier back up in bed.
And now you, another victim of the modern age. But you can be helped. I phoned some friends while you were having a bath.
They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
So this is the young man?
Fine, sir, fine.
What would you like to know, sir?
Why didn't you let us know what was happening, son?
Just a manner of speech, sir.
That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.
All right, no more picking on Dim, brother. That's part of the new way.
I did, sir.
What crime did you commit.
Not feeling too bad now are you?
Yes, sir, and a very lovely place it is too, sir, when I wake up in the middle of the night with my pain.
We always help our friends, don't we?  It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
Well, how are you then?
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.
No, sir.
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
How are you feeling today?
I haven't seen you before.
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
Oh.
I just say what the other person would say?
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Very soon now the drug will cause the subject to experience a death- like paralysis together with deep feelings of terror and helplessness. One of our earlier test subjects described it as being like death, a sense of stifling and drowning, and it is during this period we have found the subject will make his most rewarding associations between his catastrophic experience and environment and the violence he sees. Alex retching violently and struggling against his strait jacket.
You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
One thing I could never stand is to see a filthy, dirty old drunkie, howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers and going blerp, blerp in between as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking rotten guts. I could never stand to see anyone like that, whatever his age might be, but more especially when he was real old like this one was. The boys stop and applaud him.
Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
This is the poisonous young swine that near done me in. Him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me. Alex breaks away again.
I've done my best, have I not?
Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
Hullo, son, how are you?
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
Go ahead, say it.
Like what?
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...
In my office?
Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?
Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
No.
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
Lay it on me.
Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
What are you gonna do?
...this snitch of yours, what's his name, Ivan?
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD.
...if they're wrong?!
I've been calling and calling.
I came to see you, you look fine.  We gotta go.
Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please.
You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.
It's not that kind of job.
You cool, Max?  Say "I'm cool."
His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!
It's a mess.
Tonight it is.
Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.
Who's that?
What?
What you mean, no?
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
What difference does it make?
I'm sorry.
The man who hired me for this contract.
Max.  You threw my briefcase in the river.  You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
Washington and Holt.  Dance club called "Fever." Know it?
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
You had to kill Heller?!
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
What're you thinking, Jerry?
Motive?
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
What was your horse's name?
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
Switch the charts.
I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
For what?
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
If my universe had a hub...
You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
Cold War's over, Jerry.
Right here in Manhattan.
I don't know what to say.  I love you.
I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
I don't understand.
Jerry.  Please.  You don't understand.  I have to know.  It's all I think about.  Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?
Someone else might call it stalking.  My dad felt it.  He started carrying a gun.
Get in.  I'll pull you up to the fourth floor.
They changed Franklin's portrait.
What's that?
Liza Sutton is dead.
I'm leaning toward no.
You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
Night after that?
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Ah, your psychotic is here.
Tell me about it.
Do you believe me?
Where do you think Jerry is?
Now I remember why I went into theoretical work.  Kent.
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
David --
Actually I'm running late --
They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.
What...
This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
Pardon me, but you can't do -- !
Could we hear to China?
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
Could we hear God?
That's my scientist.
Why did you contact us?
No.  Please.
You live here.
A page-break signal.  A period.
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
Hokkaido Island.
Why don't you come back with me?
I do.  More than anything.  But I am also a realist.  Soon this... what is your charming term -- ?  Dog and pony show will finally be over, and I will go home.
It's beautiful but it does get a little lonely.  Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isn't to avoid excess radio traffic but because we're all such pathetic antisocial misfits... Speaking of which:  How're you getting on with the old man?
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
If we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it.  This time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology.  The moment when contact becomes possible.  We've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.
Someone tell me this is really happening.
It's really happening.
That you, Valerian?
Spoken like a true believer.
Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
Yes.  Very much.
Not exactly.  It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems.
If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
Something like that.
If you came back.  If you survived at all.  Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.
Really.
I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.
Please --
It was quite a page turner.
So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
They don't believe me.
... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer:  Why would they send me back without proof?
You kill me, you really do.  The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.
Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.
I'll make it a dollar.
You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
Lookit her bounce.
I don't know, Boss.
Luke, you run again and we'll kill you.
Borrowin' or payin' back?
She looks just like Mrs. Patricia Handy, a married woman... I useta fool with. Man, I kin sniff blondes from a hunnert yards and redheads from a mile and a half.
Come on, Drag. Lemme take a look.
Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.
I'm gonna kill you, you go on...
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
Is that your answer, Old Man? You're a hardcase too, ain't you?
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Man, it's so hot.
Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
Back a buck.
One, two, three... 
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."
He can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you.  Did you give him an approval?
Oh God.  I'm really crazy.
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
I want to die.
Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
Who are you?
What Friday?
I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it.  They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow.  It has all about how he tried to kill her.
The door was already open...
You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.
Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You have to come to me.
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
We'll keep talking.  Until they get here.  Then... 
Who is this?
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
For months... last October.
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
Then what do you need me for?
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
Is that it?
They put  Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
<u>What</u>?...
You know how to use this?
We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
I heard. Good police work.
Snotty neurotic bitch...
What's wrong with him?
Sergeant?
The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...
...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed her?
Poor darling.  What can I do about Karen? How can I arrange to have her seduce me? She desperately needs a conquest.
There, that's better.
Is that a gift from Wendel? It has an aeronautical feel to it.
What!? They brought the car here?
Have you seen it?
You're not envious?
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult.
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
Are we allowed to park here?
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.
No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else.
Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
I need to see you, Ballard. I need to talk to you about the project.
Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
Look, I know he's almost through with treatment here. And, he's on medication.
Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
What?
I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
I gather he's late as usual.
I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
I'll see you soon.
Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael.
To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.
Yes?   Go right ahead.
What if it's got a pattern?
We'll get caught.
What's my rap?
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.
Promise?
Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin?
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
Aunt Lily?
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
I sure know what that feels like.
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
Oh, ok.   Maybe.
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
I hope it wasn't something I did.
What's so urgent?   You've got me worried.
I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
I've met someone else.
It doesn't matter who.
Oh.
I've got a deposition that I really need to get cracking on, so if you don't mind...
Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. You'll love my Grandma Rosa.
They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
Hello?
You're there now?
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
Oui.
Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee?
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
You want Zero to kill him?
Bring me the scissors.
That moron.
You're sure?
Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
It's not?
I will.
Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
Everything.
Good song though.
What hotel?
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
They don't serve wine here.
-- I want to be Elvis.
Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
The baseball is mine.
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
What happened?
I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
Mr. Zammito?
No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
Yeah, I dig him.
Holy shit.
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
You ever hear of jet lag?
Who's gonna see it there?
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
I didn't have the heart.
This Jade Fox is a woman?
Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
And if I use them to kill you?
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
Hello.  What is your name?
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
How so?
Please.
Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
No, really?
Here you must be in proper attire.
Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.
Let's end this here.
What do you want?
Never!
Lo?
Give it back!
Give me back my comb.
When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars.  I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan.  I used to look for stars alone.  I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them.  I've been riding in the desert ever since.
Good.  And how are you?
What was it?
It's time for me to leave it behind.
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
No, not yet...
What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it?
My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
But don't be too lenient.
What does it say?
I don't know...
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
But the sword could be in his compound.
We must be careful.  Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security.  Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.  It might get Sir Te in trouble.
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
How 'bout the morgue?
Don't interfere.
You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.
You don't even remember...
Miss her?
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
What... the hell is that?
Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
That's right.
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
I read your teen beat manifesto.
You did?
Oh really?
The Fountainhead.
Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
Give it up.
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
How about tonight?
Doing what?
Yes.
I'm... I'm alright.
Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.
Okay?
What are you doing?
I do.
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino.
Hi.
This isn't working out for me anymore.
I love you.
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
Ben Schwarz.
- none taken -
He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
Outstanding.
Well, I guess it's getting late. Please thank Kathryn for the use of her Steinway.
Those are my letters!
See that wasn't so bad.
It was nothing.
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
Something awful happened last night.
Does your mother know?
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
What year are you in?
But I thought high school is only four years.
You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
What, nervous I'm going to win?
Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy shit.
She bought it.
McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
I told you I don't know.
Racist piece of shit.
It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
Care to make a wager on that?
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
Moving along quite well.
I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems.
Nothing.
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
She shot you down.
Exactly the opposite.
Excuse me?
I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
Ronald?
Get off me!
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
I think you have your answer.
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
Do you know when she'll be back?
I'll do that.
Did you hit her?
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
I love the smell of pine.
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
Mommy --
Did your wishes ever come true?
Sometimes.
On the back street — a green house
Well — the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you.
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
But it's already come true.
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
Irena.
Yes, darling,
I think I should.  3000W?
Did you hear the child out?
I'm never unfair.
You're shouting at me.
Where did you get it?
What's funny?
But I told her to go with you.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
Yes, daddy.
Yes, daddy.
Why didn't you run after them?
It was just a voice.
Yes, Amy?
In the garden? Would she be there now?
But there's no one here, darling.
Who are you?
You'll always play with me?
Oh, thank you, Amy.
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
May I pet the deer?
You mustn't be afraid.
You?
That's a fine-looking ring.
It's a pretty ring.
I wasn't singing to myself.
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
No, thank you.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
I've been working out.
There was a sale.
I mean where on your body?
PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
What does that have to do with me?
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
What? Why the hell did he do that?
I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
What did he say?
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
So where's this infamous arm now?
You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
Did you get rid of Mark?
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
What? Why'd you do that?
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
You expecting someone?
"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
I thought you and George were getting married.
You're kidding, really?
So there I was, hanging from the edge of a bridge, when my mom said, "Son, you got into Harvard!" It took three of them to pull me back! Frida keeps eating.
That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
This really isn't a good time.
You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
Are you following me?
Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
What are they for?
Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?
Everything okay?
No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
You know, I've never seen your cat.
Your breasts feel larger.
They do? Oh no...
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes.
We didn't have sex.
A kiss? Did you have sex with him?
No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
He was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
He was found a few blocks away.
Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
What?
I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.
She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
What of?
The other one?
How will we interrogate them?
Just visiting my patient.
Was that for real down there?
Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnít with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, howís your mother?
Itís extremely important to my investigation...
I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.
What now?
I see.  The verdict, yes...
Shut up!
You know something about me?
Why?
You understand what you'll be doing?
Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
The Washington Post.
Oh... I'm fired?
Where's the girl?
Check his kids.
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
Okay, let's see... you can have him on Tuesday the 25th...
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
Extend things?
Oh my God...
Now some of this may feel a bit Strange at first.  You gotta remember that even a professional Politician has Some trouble getting used to...
At a press conference.
... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
`Dave'?
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
How'd you get started?
You got a gun?
Call Bob and Reed.  Tell them I need them immediately.
Didn't mean to bum you out.
Don't you have anything to say to me?
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
I care about the homeless.
... How could I what?
Look.  If there was some mistake...
Oh yeah?  Me, too.
I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
Where are you going?
What?
That's a secret.
What's wrong?
I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.
I missed...
We're working on it.
It can't be. Are we truly in hell?
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!
What is it if it ain't a curse?
We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
What is it?
I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital...
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.
Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
So what the hell's Mutt been up to?
Well, I'd better find Patsy.  Say hello to Mutt for me.
Sounds boring to me.
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
Why doesn't he let you do what you want?
How was dinner?
Come on.  It'll help you get Chris.
It will?  How do you figure?
What is the point?
What do you mean you don't know?
It's every bit as hard as they say. Unless you're a genius like Meeks.
All right.  I'll try anything once.
It's such a strange name!  Won't you tell us what it means?
I told you, that's a secret.
Yeah!    Don't you guys miss having girls here?
You know what really excites me about you?
What?
Nuwanda?  Please?
Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead.
I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately."  I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life!"
What happened? Were you kicked out?
What are you going to do? - Charlie?
Why don't you talk to Mr. Keating about it?
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
Knox, I don't believe this!
Then come with me.
God, if Chet found out he'd...
Dead Poets honor.
What is that?
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  The Latin term for that sentiment is "Carpe Diem." Anyone know what that means?
Very good, Mr._?
Oh Captain, My Captain.  What if we don't know anything about someone like Rahesh Non?
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.
Again!  Louder!
YAWP!
Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door.  What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it.
A sweaty-toothed madman
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
Neil, I know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what you're feeling.  You have to let him see who you are-  It's your only chance.
Too bad.
Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
Father, I wasn't disputing you.
When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?!  "My niece is in a play with your son," Mrs. Marks says.  "You must be mistaken," I say.  "My son isn't in a play."  You made a liar out of me, Neil! Now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting.
Where is this cave he's talking about?
Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
What is it?
My parents wanted me here all along but my grades weren't good enough.  I had to go to Balincrest to pull them up.
What?
What is it then?
But why?  Don't you understand what Keating is saying?  Don't you want to do something about it?
So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
Neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?
Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
Here, villain, draw and ready. where art thou?
Visit from my father.
Do you have to quit the play?
You the Captain?
How do we get out of here?
You remember the first time we met Finnegan? I think you were just starting out...smuggling gold off Sumatra for those two Chinese...what did we use to call them?
Where are my men?
I'm not a thief.
Then who are you?
Noooo!
Jesus Christ lady...
Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
Here's what I think...I think these mokes below are a hit sqaud.
Joey... Which way's aft?
Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to...
What the hell does that mean?
What is it man?
Maybe it's the wrong ship.
Hey! What are you trying to pull!
Don't shoot, man, don't shoot!
Those are mine!
John,we're going huntin'.
Ammo! Get the ammo!
Tell him, Vince!
In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
That's new, isn't it?
Married?
Did you ever think life would turn out like this?
But you must come in.
See, I'm going home.
But of course! Please make yourself comfortable. Perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar, or une petite glace, or --?
I came to see Merle.
I love Linda, see. I love Linda more than I can even say.
Get anything?
No.
You know a guy named Merle?
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
Hey, guys...
Oh, well...
Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!
'Course how could you miss, right? Twenty, maybe thirty feet. I mean, if I'd'a been where you guys were --
Where's it gone?
Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
Rough.  We didn't have to do it, John.
Sit with Linda, man, will ya?... Give her a beer.  Would you like a beer?
What kind of beer would you like?
I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car...  I thought someone stole you away!
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
I'm just so lonely.
You seem... disturbed.
Up north.
Who the hell is he?
I want to go home, Merle.
The shot?
Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?
Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do.
You think we'll ever come back?
I love this fuckin' place... That sounds crazy. I know that sounds crazy, but I love this fuckin' place... If anything happens, Nick, don't leave me there. I mean it. Don't leave me... You gotta promise, Nick. You gotta promise me that.
Promise! You gotta promise!
Hey, Nick?
No.
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight?
Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean --
It's Merle, Sal.
Phantom Mary?
What the hell's that for?
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
Just like always! Just like it always was! Right, Nick? Am I right?
What the hell was that!  What did you think? Did you think it was loaded!
Up.
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
Later.  I want Doucet first.
Tell Frick and Frack that means them too.
This is a war, Wade.  You against him.  Vengeance time.  The City's just in the way.  Kill the fucker. You and me.  We'll work things out when the time is right.
Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
Fine.
You okay?
Nobody's looking.

Got it.  Ejection seat?
How do you know?
Thanks.  Want'a bite?  McDonald's vegiroll.
Bacon cheeseburgers.
You can't catch this man with a computer.
Hey, I'm eating.
Yes, sir.
Get us some fuck'n back-up now!
You treat her nice.
They always are.
Seat's too high.
Jabez! Careful --
It hasn't opened yet?
Why? It don't hurt.
Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
Lan's to goodness, what happened to that hen? Did you use that beanshooter again?
Howdy, Jabez.
I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
You are afraid!
But what becomes of our souls?
I do -- and I think you should too.
You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
Good evening, Neighbor Stone.
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
You know darn well it is.
That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
Howdy, Squire! Howdy! Oh -- how do you do, Squire.
You keep that -- that's for you. I want you to talk up the party to make sure that the best folks really come.
Not all of it?
Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
Worried!
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
I'll get it, Jabez.
Yes, Mr. Selectman!
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 
Potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun, Sleep, sleep, my baby -- Raccoon sits in the spruce all night, Sleep, baby, sleep --
Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
Hush up such talk, Jabez!
Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
It seems such an obvious candidature to us all.
Mary -- Jabez --
What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
What's that?
So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
If your friend is hot to trot...I know a couple of mama bears.  ...Or is he married?
The past six months.
It's okay, it's okay.
I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI. This is Agent Johnson...no relation.
One of yours?
What's happening?
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
John.
How about his job?
What am I, a method actor?  Hans, babe, put away the gun.  This is radio, not television...
Hope I'm not interrupting...?
I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you!  You're just going to have to kill me --
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
How long?
You better heat up that miracle				* you were talking about.  We broke through on Number Six, and the Electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer...
Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
I'm ahead of you...partner.
I still feel like shit.
I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell.
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
Yeah.  A lot of guns.
Yeah, well I don't blame him.
Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit.
I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
What?
How did they think that?  What are they... crazy?  What do you mean. That's bullshit, Leon.  They're giving you a fucken story.
Where are they now?  Just tell me... are they on the phone now?
Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
I can't talk to him.
Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
Okay, give us the women.
... armed robbery ...
The girl hostages.
Yeah ...
There won't be ... there won't be ... What else do you need?  How else can we help you?
What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
What's the matter with you?
Hello... I'm sorry I can't talk to you right now... I suggest you call during banking hours tomorrow. What is your name?
Howard, give him the keys...
For God's sake, will you please go now?  We gave you every nickel we got.
What if I take you with me?
You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on ...  ... let's get him out ...
I'll be God damned if you will.
We like you, too.
Thanks again, Sam.
It's up to you ladies.
It was on the TV.
Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  He can't make it.
Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out.  Okay?
Does that still go?
Sonny -
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
Bullshit!
At the airport.  We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.
What can he do, he's clean...
Okay - you got your one.
Listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language.
What's the matter... they never housebroke you?
For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again ...
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
Oh.  Run.
Robbing a bank.
But I mean, why do you need to steal?  Couldn't you get a job?
What about, ah, non-union occupations?
<i>They can do subtitles.</i>
<i>I forgot.</i>
Bail jumper's name is Cookie Kincaid. Nineteen years old. His mommie posted bail when he was arrested for allegedly partaking in a drive-by shooting in Hawthorne.
Fella takes out two kids and has the audacity to not show up for trial.
Will you speak the fucking English language? The poor girl has no clue what you're talking about.  The boy speaks English, you know. Reads, writes, I swear it. He does this when he's around girls. Thinks it's cute.
Tell him it's not cute. Will you tell him, Domino!?
<i>Mr. Cigliuti?</i>
I've already formulated a plan.
Yes.
He's a reality television producer. His name is Mark Weiss.
Are you aware that Lateesha Rodriguez has been running a counterfeit driver's license racket?
<i>You drove Lateesha's daughter to school... then dropped her off at the DMV. Why?</i>
Everyone... please give Domino her space. Step back, please!
Three tours? Isn't that... <i>twelve years?</i>
But real. This is gritty. Like Cassavetes.
You were good.
I almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please.  Who the fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone and shit.
You almost knocked me down.  The word is "excuse me."
Who told you to step on my sneakers? Who told you to walk on my side of the block?  Who told you to be in my neighborhood?
So, in other words, you are not down.
How much?
Extra cheese is two dollars. Y'know dat.
Don't come back, either.
What da fuck!  Are you deaf?
Buggin' Out, I gotta work here.
You the man.
No, you the man.
It's so nice to see a family hanging out together.
Make it plain.
Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
I thank you.
Mookie.
I said my name is Eddie Lovell.
Eddie, you're too smart for your own britches.  Listen to me.  How much do you want to run to the store for Da Mayor?
Wake up!
It's gonna be hot today.
Do me a favor.  Go to work.
What responsibilities?
Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
Sorry, comb got caught.
Twenty "D" Duracells.
Twenty "C" Duracells.
Here ya are.  Keep the change.
What?
I would like to get paid now.
I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
How much?  How much do I owe you?
You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria?
Yeah!...I'm goin' to the beach for the first day in fifteen years. Gonna take the day off and go to the beach.
I want you to spend some time with me.  I want you to try and make this relationship work.  If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
Trust you?  Because of trusting you we have a son.  Remember your son?
Mister Señor Love Daddy is cool.
Sez who?
You really think so?
I like Mookie a lot.
I should have Vito go with you all the time.
Too many pizzerias already there.
I didn't think so.
You're gonna be in the street with the rest of your homeboys.
I don't get it. Why'd you make him a pirate?
Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip.
Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...
Yeah...
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
HARRY? Are you okay?
The name's Walter.
Is it okay if he spends the night?
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
Home school? What's that?
I go to school where I live.
Can we eat there tomorrow?
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
Your mom made a move on me.
Shut Up! Buttlick!
No.
Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
You have beautiful eyes.
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward.
Hey, look. Ice cream.
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
Start the tape, Lloyd.
Hey there goes Principal Collins!
Right.
Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
You really are a pirate.
So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob?
What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.
That's the downside. There is none.
Ha! I said "doll-hairs." Psych! But a deal's a deal, my friend. In you go.
It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
Hey you two. Lights out.
What are you crazy kids doing in my tool shed?
You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
Anyway, the state is giving a hundred thousand dollars in his name to every school that has a Special Needs class.
Wow, you are smart.
What?
Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
Don't touch my mother...
What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
Stop him yourself.
Are you a Fremen?
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly.
THE PAIN!
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
What is it?
I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...
Did they try and fail?
Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!
But you're a big star!
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one?
"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
Eddie, this is quite a scene.
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are we gonna make another picture?
So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
So guess where I'm going next weekend?
PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!
Edward Wood, Sir.
What?
Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it?
Who?  Robert Taylor?!
It's a shame.  He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.
Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message.
Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.
That's not true --
It's Wood.  Ed Wood.
I like to think so.
Mr. Reynolds!
Could we moovf to table?
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
I like.  When do movie shoot?
Yes?
My pleasure.  I'm Orson Welles.
No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!
They'll notice.  Look, why don't you let me take over from here?  I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...
"Where's the ads"?!  The ads are in Alabama, Indiana, and Missouri!  You schmuck, it ain't gonna play L.A.!
Because I can't sell it to save my life!  You made a goddamn feathered fish.  Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick?  Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it.
Oh, hi.
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
Huh?
Oh.  Okay.
Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
You know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better!
The poor girl's out of a job.
But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
Uh, look, I'm with some friends, and we're about to eat --
Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?
Hey.  This is looking good!  Paul, where's the octopus motor?
This is our choir director.  He's gonna play the young hero.
Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
My goodness, you're embarrassing me.
You mean like a date?  I thought you were a fag.
No, I intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause I don't like you.
Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
Ed, can I see you a second.
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
Yeah?!
Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off --
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
I thought -- I thought he was dead.
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
Yeah.  Honey, if you're watching this is for you.
You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?
No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
St. Joseph's.
What happened?
It was horrible. He called me up.
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
What is she, at work?
How much less?
Cream rinse?
Okay ...
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
Where?
I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone.
Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
What did you do to your hair?
My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.
What do you mean all of a sudden? You've been going with her six months.
What?
Yeah. I service video equipment.
You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies?
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
I mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place?
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
Why me?
No -- keep it.
You don't recognize me.
Who is it?
I was in jail.
Good?
Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?
Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out.
pierdes.
You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy.
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
Sure
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.
Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
Okay, Jim. I understand.
Just wait outside. Tammy.
This weekend.
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
Which door?
I don't believe you.
No, I... uh, didn't know that
I was lonely.  You took advantage
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
I also like bananas.
Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.
And 290 "disregards," right?
You said I was a liar   You're the liar, you're the --
Are you crazy?
No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
What'd I do?
Yeah.  Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. 'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything.  But that's okay, you know.  l respect your privacy.  I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. We're still brother and sister.  Okay? Cause... and I hope you feel the same.
Till 19-fucking-70.
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
We talked.
In the morning.
Captain, what do you want?
I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the go-ahead on. A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  You'll be working out of Homicide.
Will you work for me?
How what, Wendell?
You know him?
Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
Maybe.  I don't know.
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett.
Let's just kill them.
There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.
What about him?
I don't know him.  Mr...
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you?
Dogs got no reason to live.
Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.
What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!
Take it easy!  I didn't have anything to do with him getting killed if that's what you mean.
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships.
Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
Answer yes or no.
Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl.
I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.
You're the key witness?
I need to speak to you.
Damnit... <u>What</u>?
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
Why do men and women usually see each other?
You sound like you mean it.
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
Why not?
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
My daughter was a virgin!
They're sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree.
<u>Hush-Hush</u>.  Off the record and on the Q.T.
Sid, it's Vincennes.
What happened with the kid and Loew?
You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
Loew didn't go with him.  You're sure?
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Working whores with squad two.
I don't know anything about Zavitz.
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
Listen--
You've got it on tape?
No one. But I'm a little nervous.
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
You knew the deal. No contact.
Who was that other guy?
Yes.
It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
Why are they after <u>me</u>?
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
<u>Here</u>?!
What the fuck?!
Drive.
What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
Feeling lucky?
Is Jerry Delsano in?
The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
What are you saying?
Hi, Mr. Dean.
Remain calm.
Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
Yes?
I didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.
No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. Your name keeps coming up.
I'm no expert, but I'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused--
I'm just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.
Than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
Was he with anyone?
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
Just for the criminals.
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
Right.
What do you mean?
In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.
No.
Well, you know--
It's not true.
You <u>swore</u>!
I told you I didn't want you seeing her.
The date stamp on the picture is last <u>month</u>. Is that where you and Rachel conduct business.
Stacy, don't hang up.
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
I'm looking at a picture of you and Rachel taken <u>yesterday</u>.
That's okay.
Albert's gonna get me my job back.
I'm sorry, sir, this card's been declined.
DePinto?
Why would I--
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
You're not.
How can I be sure.
Thank you.
There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I've worked for the mob. The <u>mob</u>, Bobby!
I gotta go.
That's temporary.
I <u>did</u> care how.
He didn't.
--otherwise we may have to--
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
--otherwise we may have to--
I got a call this morning from a source I trust. The Post is running a lead this afternoon about your involvement in the Bellmoth investigation.
Why?
Some of 'em.
Where've you been?
You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em?
Usually they take clothes.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.
The Congressman's very happy to have your support, but he's heard that there's an investigation.
Jerry--
Bobby--
Bobby--
Rachel's dead?
Yes.
Why would the NSA--
You're tired.
To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
Was Zavitz in trouble?
What is it you want?
You didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.
Who?
Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir?
We'd have to--
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
Federal Express?
You have any idea what kind of position this--
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
What do you mean, poetry?
He said - be careful.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
This is not very good, is it?
Shall we be all right?
No.
You don't sew at all!
What?  No!
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
This is empty, just coming!
It's beautiful.  What's it about?
That day, had you followed me to the market?
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
Dance with me.
No.
We've got to get you out of here.
Yes.  Absolutely.
Tell me about your garden.
Almásy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore.
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but…  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
I told you so.
It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41.  And this -February 42.
It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
Hana?  Hana?  Are you alright?
Hello.
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
Irving Berlin.
Why do you think?  About my staying?
I think you know all of us, except for Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've recently come out from England.
And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons.
To arm-twisting.
He's Canadian.
Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
I'll probably marry him.
Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
I mean home.  India.
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
Only we have to go to work.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
I had a hotel room.
What's happening?  Am I needed?
You should sit down, darling.  She's quite all right.  Are you pregnant?
I'll come with you.
Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
Or my wife's.
A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
You don't call, you don't write.
I don't know, but close.
Too late now.
I don't want to waste your time.
Uh, yes.
You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
Somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on.
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
Oh?
It's a test.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
We're going to die, aren't we...
And good morning.
True enough.
Someone was expecting that.
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
No, no, I want to. I'll just go into the village.
Aren't we all.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
Yes. Yes.
It's your mistake.
The big job.
What?
Insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner.
What about the rules?
Pulse detectors.
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
Four billion dollars.
That's because you grew up rich.
They drive so recklessly there.
The disc is still in there.
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
The key to success is using the right tools.
We're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. The air filters might be wired. And a bypass hose for the AC.
I'd say she's a size 6 who wears a size 4.
You look like George Washington.
Suspicious, after all these years?
See you.
I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick --
Yeah.
You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna?
Five million dollars?
They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now.
Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a rÈsumÈ, make an --
I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.
You're a girl.
Excuse me?
Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
But, PG&E told her about the chromium?
Course I did.
This is the only thing you found?
At least they made an offer.
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
You wanna talk about --
Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here.  This is some damn good work.
Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.
Really?  It makes me sick.
I want my fucking money --
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here --  Do you mind?
Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass for you.  I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  And what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?
Not in my world.
If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off --
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
You're not gonna be there.
I was working in the compressor, and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says, we're gonna give you a shredder machine, and send you on down to the warehouse.  We want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there.
Ross.
You come to the right place.
Hey, Ross.  Tell me something.  Does PG&E pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Yeah.
You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
How?
I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?
It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.
No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin.  There's a lot of jobs out there.
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
I didn't say that.
I'm bored, and so are the kids.
That is not what I'm --
Hello?
How long's this whole thing gonna take?
Have you been logging on?
What?
Wow, that's soon --
Who's Baxter?
I'm cold ... so cold ...
I can help them!
I feel The Force.
I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
That's right.
And what are they, pray tell?
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
What was it?
Hey!  Someone's still in here.
I take it back.
They're moving away.
Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
Stop that.
No lightspeed?
What'd you have in mind for your next move?
You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
Hyperdrive.
Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
No.
What about Han?
What'd you say?
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
You don't have to do this to impress me.
What are you talking about?
He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
This hyperdrive had better work.
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.
Good God.
Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
With food?
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
I mean he's of your race. He's an Ape.  Look.  You don't have to be afraid.  We've put him in chains and under sedation. Do you understand that?
I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
All right, so I made another deal.
I see your point. What's the favor?
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
So what's the deal, gorgeous?
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
Does he know how to activate it?
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
How do you know all this?
They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?  Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
Find Cuervo Jones.
Well, I'll think it over.
You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.
Move aside!
You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--
Merlin, will I live...?  ...I was dreaming...
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how--
What?!
Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy.
At your service, sir.
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
I left it in the tent, sir.
Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen.
The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
The well-kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart.
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
The law forbids it.
The King without his sword, the land without a king...
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.
Merlin! Out of the sick sleep at last.
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
Hello?
Not that I know of.
Rats?
But it's clean?
What!
Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?
Is it coming out Willie?
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
So, what causes this?
Chris MacNeil?
No.
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
I didn't get you?
But how?
What else?
What's the difference?
Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
Oh look at that.
I found it.
Wait a minute you need two.
No you don't. I do it all the time.
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
Captain Howdy.
Oh, Captain Howdy....
What are we gonna do on your birthday, isn't that nice it's on a Sunday this year, what can we do?
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
Oh you did. What did you hear?
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
People get tired.
What are you doing here?
Mother please! Oh please mother make it stop! It's burning, it's burning please mother!
Karras.
Where'd you get it then?
Think you can sleep?
I came to say goodbye.
Withering Heights.
I'm not Regan.
It would bring us together.
Bon Jour.
Is that too tight?
No.
Now momma you have to stay off it, you can't keep go up and down those stairs you have to give it rest.
We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous. He is a liar, the demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us. The attack is psychological , Damien. And powerful. So don't listen, remember that, do not listen.
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
And also with you.
Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
Come on!
Who is it?
Is it Captain Howdy?
No.
Why not?
Take it now.
I've got the grands for two nights, Charlie.  You can't just --
Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
Swimming trunks.
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
You the magician?
What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday.  Thanks.
What's wrong with it?
Count it.
You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative?
You're their uncle.
You look awful.
Seeing anyone in particular?
This time you gotta go.
You gotta go.
What're you talking about?
So you'll come out, right?
Your doorbell doesn't work.
Terrific.
You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me we're different.  We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.
Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.
It's early.
No.
Have some more wine, Frank.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
Accommodate?  I don't think I know what you mean.
No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
How dare you say you love me.
What the hell are you doing?
Half-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna get breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet?
Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?
What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
He's with the hotel.  I called him.
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
What do you mean?
You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
No.
Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
Looks like these got a few years on them.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
Charlie called.
Christ, that's right.  How could I forget.  What a nightmare.
And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career.
Uh... he knows it.
My watch is broken, too.
So run a little longer.
Miss --
When we know.
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
What I mean is --
What's he talking about?
Nine!
Uh... good.
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
Give me that.
I guess it's,the Plaza then. That brings us to the twenty-seventh. We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two.
Virgins?
Huh?
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
I just saw a man walk out of your room.
Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
I'll call you.
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
No.
Baker.  Jack Baker.
Right.  Bring him back.
Regular hours are eight to five.
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
Hey, he's not sore, is he?
Where's egghead?
It's okay.  Last one.
How's egghead?
What'd I say?
I'm not upset.
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
Nina?
Who's Nina?
Soap convention.
My father proposed to my mother in there.
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Frank said ---
Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
Yeah.
Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new place.  Or we could go to a bar ...  Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know a place uptown, if you want --
Tell egghead I said hi.  If you see him.
Losing his teeth.
In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop.  Then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him.
I guess it's getting serious.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
From Hurley's?
My place.
Nice-looking kid.
You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
Pollux ...
So?
You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
Thanks, Pollux.
For being one helluva guy.
Must've been after we got engaged.
No.
You can't go.  You can't be anywhere near that place.
We can send in a plant -- try to get Pollux to spill the location.
You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
Get a higher arc on the ball, Jamie.  And for Chrissake, square your shoulders to the basket.
You merciless bastard!
You're the only person in this place who can see right through me.
I just thought that -- under the circumstances -- you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs.
The hospital.
-- what?
Where's Jamie?
You too?  This holiday's about giving, Adelle.  And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone...  Lifesaver?
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
You?  Married?
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybody’s here.
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
Rise...and...shine...!
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
Do you like kids?
Five thirty.  Okay.
Like what?
I’m having kind of a bad day.
Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isn’t the life I dreamt about.  Where’s the romance, where’s the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you can’t have...
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
Look, maybe I’m not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one.  A little flirtation’s harmless but you’re playing with fire here.  The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor.  You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
I’m telling you, those rules don’t apply to me, Arn.
We bowl together. We’re bowlers ...we won a championship...we’re winners.
Yes you do...
You just said everyone needs something.
I've got everything I need.
Finger food...?
Evelyn, right?
Something like that.
Sorry, pal.  Entrance is for residents and guests only...
I have a bad feeling about this.
Don’t  go, Jack...
You mean don’t go at all? What about my internship?
No, you’re right.  What are we doing?
Are you okay?
What are you doing?
But it’s twenty degrees outside...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
No?
Well...Annie for one.
I think it worked out okay, don’t you?
Sure.  I really like Annie.
The trek out to the hospital every day didn’t help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
Then say it...just say it to me...!
What’s the difference? I’m taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
Now I’m worried...just say it.  Whatever it is we’ll deal with it.
But you always seem so certain.
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
So what’s the big surprise? You didn’t rent this place for the weekend, did you?
I’m talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
I can do that.  I want to do that.  For all of us. I need to do that as a man...  Think about it.  No more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow...
To Paris. Paris, France.
Where is he?
Peter Lassiter...
...we’re really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
Okay, I’ll take them...
No...I’m not...
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
I want to see you again.
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
Don't you have anywhere to go?
That’s totally see through...
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --
Relax, it's casual.
I can't take this.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
What the --!
You got a chisel round here?
Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
No more cracks about how I look.
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
Ben?
What are <u>you</u> doing here?
About me?  How sweet.
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
Now what is up with <i>that</i>?
Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse!
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
You're on fire!
Apparently I can disappear.
Sweet.
Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side.
Not until Ben is back inside!
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when --
What are you doing?
And reverse the mutations --
And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
Why didn't you say something?
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
Raising the shields.
I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back...
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
Where do we stand?
That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
Doctor...without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart?
If I were in their place and I'd run out of time, I'd abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own...
The Other Side got to him.
Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --
As part of the Crew.
Yes, a fistula too small to show up on the X-rays.
Doctor...you can't mean that! Not when we've come this far. And if we give up, there'll be no way of saving Mr. Benes --
I'll try to hold it from the other side of the wall, while you push from out here. Maybe that'll do it.
No, it requires such absolute precision --
As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duval's onto me, too?
Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber -- one of the countless Alvioli of the Lung -- and we can't get enough to fill a microscopic tank.
We'll never get there in time, at this rate.
"Yet all the suns that light the Corridors of the Universe shine dim, Before the blazing of a Single Thought -- "
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
Looks like the sea, at dawn.
May I?
'Prepare for Miniaturization'...
Uh -- what?
I'll never find my way through that.
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
Wuddya do?  Carl looks around.
I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.
Unguent.
Huh?
What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it.  So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters.
Oh, geez.
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
Yah, okay, but, uh -
...Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now -
GOT IT?
Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -
We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five!
I dunno. Just funny-looking.
Yah?
Yeah!
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
Yah!
Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?
No! We can't let anyone know about this thing! We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing!
Mr. Lundegaard?
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
...Babe the Blue Ox?
Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
Yah, real good. How you doin'?
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
Well... yah.
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.
Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?
...Dad?
Stan Grossman called.
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
Stan and I're okay.
Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade. Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade.
...Well, that passed.
You don't think he's mixed up in -
Uh-huh.
Geez! You look great!
No, no, that's fine.
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
Yah.
Hon?
Yah?
Yeah, couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel?
Was it reasonable?
She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it...
Oh.
And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
It must've been Tuesday.  he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.
Hmm?
I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
This is... really a shock...
I'd like to thank the academy...
You need to lighten up.
Can't you give me something?
Sure.
I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
Why are you doing this?
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
I'm just on my way out...
So you're staying in tonight?
It's time for you to leave.
You... don't have to... leave.
Can I come in?
What kind of stupid question is that?!
We've just lost cabin pressure.
What?
Yes... it's a test.
What?
Excuse me?  "Throwers?"
Tell the other person how you feel.
One minute.  This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
What do you want me to do?
How's that working out for you?
I don't... think so.
No, I...
You're welcome.  But, I want you to do me one favor.
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
Is it?
Hum.
If you could fight any celebrity?
Doesn't matter.
Okay... Ghandi.
Huh?
Newcastle?  Did you start that one?
You know what I mean.
What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
You took me to the house.
The house is rented in your name.
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
Yes...
Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
Tyler...
This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
Damn it!  God-damn it...
Why are you doing this?!
Do something for me.
Abort the plan.
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.
The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
Signs?
You were there?
What did you see?  What am I looking for?
Should we knock?
Random, sure.
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Good.  Cause we just got some new info and I don't need you getting freaky on me.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.
Yeah, so what happened?
THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!
Do you remember what triggered it all?
I know.  I've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp. We're all meeting at my apartment tonight.
I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
Shouldn't we pull over?
This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
More than that.  All the songs on the radio were about car crashes. Some kid's banging toy cars together.  She was dialing her cell phone with her headset on.  His car was leaking oil all over the road.
Sure.
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.
Stop the car!
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes.
Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did.  They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week.  Got a smoke?
You mean the snake?
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
Read you.
This place is a trip.
That guy's not going to make it.
I'm getting him out.
You never been in one of those things.
I have arranged transportation.  We meet soon.  But I think you to be disappointed.
Thanks.
We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.
He's giving them a run for their money.  Says here they've got two Hueys from Danang.  I didn't know those dinks had Hueys.
Christ almighty.
I know...
Listen up.  You two are married as of now.  Get used to it.
...SO...anybody special in your life?
What?
...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.
I think some people are meant to be alone.  Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts... 
I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
No really..I can't.
I can't tell you how distraught I was.  All night long.  What the hell happened?
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
You still believe in God?
What do you think?
My agent.  I called my agent.
What have you been doing here!  <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>!  <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
What if I was a relative?
Yes... I... I agree...
You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
Fine.
Your name was picked.
So how do we do this?
Oh, Lydia!
My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry?  Breakfast?  A fruit pie perhaps?
They're --  -- What?
No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest.
The Little...
I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
So what? You going to help me?
How about the "Hell Merchants"?
It sounds exciting.
Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
Listen, you're very nice... b...
... It's not just from tonight.  I've known you for a long time.  I see you come out of work every day.  I walk with you to lunch.  I know what you order... I see you buy Baby Ruths before going back in...  I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore...  ... I know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated  ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and I love you.   I love you.  I think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and I would be knocked out several times if I even got just a first kiss.  But I'll be back in the morning.  And I won't be distant.  And I will call if you let me... But I still don't drink coffee.
If you're sayin' you're somethin' better'n what I am, that's one thing. But I can't say much a someone who'd run off an' leave a woman in a situation like this an' feel easy about it. An' that's all I gotta say.
Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song.
You just going to sit there?
You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
What?
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
No substitutions.
Wait, I've made up my mind. I want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee.
You want me to hold the chicken.
Tea.
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
This is a very special, very old CB 275...
What?
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
With applesauce?
Look at that.
It's none of your business!
Where's Catherine?!
But what about me?
Bye, now.
I guess you fell in the water.
Besides piano and swimming, what else do you do?
Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.
I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me...
You don't call that music, though.
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
Is that funny?
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
I don't find your language that charming.
Serious, that's what's important to you?
No inner feeling.
That's what you said?
No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...
Robert, do you mind?
I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...
What kind of doggy is that?
Don't call me "honey," mack.
Mass production is what does it.
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
Hi.
You got a boyfriend?
I got punished, man.
They are?
What are you going that way for?
Which one?
Positive.
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
Hey!
First of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation. I'm not going through formal channels here, because if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody has to know I was even --
Look. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be sure. Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats.
Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.
I have no idea.
Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this very much anymore... but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that way.
Ask anybody.
One. B-a-b-a-r.
Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
No idea.
Like tonight.
The two surfer boys?
Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.
Oh my God!
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
My parents were great fans of the former President.
Right.
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....
Check.
Ten days ago?
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
Not mine, stupid. Yours.
I know.
Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Why don't you try suicide?
Maybe I'm just on vacation.
Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?
Thanks.
Yeah.
'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Depends on the question.
Are you still in love with Alan?
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
What is this?
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
You can't do that.
I'm her cousin.
You broke it? You know the source?
What's 'practically'? Is it Fat Sam? You said you had pictures of him....
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
Not really?
I was upset.
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
I'll do my best.
I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck.
Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.
So what about this watch?
Three hundred.
You gave it to the girls for one.
Let's get serious...
Why are all these people after me?
People still watch that?
Are you okay?
Pretty smooth, huh?
Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
Gut feeling.
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
It's me.
If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
Two words.  Disco Express.
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane.  He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it.  After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you.
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
Shit.
I'm still the king!
You're that guy, the private eye.
I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
I don't...
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
Henri c'est gentil d'être venu.  Je vous présente mon associé, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.
Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
J'ai pas confiance en lui.
There'll be someone else.
All right, get up on that bar and dance.
What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops?
Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
I make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner.  The guy is the stripe combo, I know him too.
What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
Where'd you get this fag shit?
Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City.
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
Yeah.
So what?
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
Why haven't they killed the juice?
Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
I'm off.
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
Frank, please...
Frank, this is insane...
Okay, start pedaling.
Yes!  That's it!  You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief!
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
What?
What'd you just say?
Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father...
That's impossible.
You sound...ground up...?
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
What's that?
I never knew you, Dad.
It did, Pop.  It did.
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
What are we like in...1998?
Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
Hang on a sec, John.
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
What...
What are you doing here, Satch?  You off today?
I'm not your uncle, kid.  Gordo, what are you doing here?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Uh, huh.
I look familiar?
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time.  But you gotta stop doing these things.  Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I?  So don't embarrass me.  When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
What was that?
How about you and I whacking a couple of balls around?
Hey Deb... can you hear me?
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
Do you want a beer or not?
Maybe we should do some exercise.
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
Your bed.
I don't know.
What?
Somebody was in here.
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
Could we move a little faster?
What are we gonna do?
Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
Got any good ideas?
This is no time to celebrate!
You don't "have to."
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
Darren, we better turn around.
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
Come on, you guys!  The game's over!!
Jason who?
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
...And I said, shut up!
Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I'll be back as soon as I can.
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
So what are ya drawin'?
No.
Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?
Did you hear me?!
Are they grown-ups?
Boy scouting.
I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
Eight times.
In the media, you've frequently been described as "salty" --
I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of --
So let's talk.
Anything else?
Legs giving you trouble?
Steven buggin' you?
Listen...don't you worry about Ed. He'll come around.  He's too good a Sheriff to let you give him the slip.
She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
Sorry.
Lock this asshole up.
Her name's Stephanie.
Don't do anything stupid.
How many times do you want to hear this?
No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
Have you seen Tamara?
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
He's undefeated, you know that?  Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is.
It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
Jason's here in New York.
She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...
I...I can't...
Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school.
I can't swim.
I...I don't know...
I've got the numbers.
I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...
I used to drive a taxi.
I never left the garage without my Windex.
Under the Manhattan Bridge.
Shut up, Elliot.
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
It's over, finished and done with.
But didn't we know it would happen?
We must abandon.
Tonight. What's tonight?
And he was there?
I'm not ready.
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
Our Peter?
Can he get through it?
What?
Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
We're able to surprise each other.
In and out of bed.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
I have a class. I'm late.
I'm willing to tell you my name.
You have to tell me what you thought of the play.
What else?
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
This could be it!
Life is true.
Pop, will you let me in?
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
I know, Pop.
Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
How come you got the kid with you?
What am I doing?
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
What do you mean?
This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
A little.
Endearing.
You know what.
Where are you going now?
If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
Our Steven not only disguises himself.
Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.
Oww!
"Take a fifth step, that we may serve the people."
I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine.
Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
A -- a week.
The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it.
It was one incident.
And Jinnah?
Well, it's quite a place, your "ashram" -- is that right?
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
Hm.  Is it?
I would rather march.
Do you find me stubborn?
It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man.
I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such "exception" to.
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
Good. Good.  I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to "investigate" the new legislation.  I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed.
...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest.  And it still goes on.
He's addressed this letter directly to you, has he?
You almost sound like you believe that.
Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
How are you doing this, Vincent?  How have you done <i>any</i> of this?
We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
A man's dead, Detective.
Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.
You know their workforce.  Two-thirds at least fall into the category.  We'll be closing down their operation for days.  At least go with a fingertip sample or urine.
That's the last.
We believe we have a suspect.
At least it's nothing contagious.
Six one.
What about this?
What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?
11.15 to the port.  A maintenance crew.
How long do you stay up there before you go?
--What car?--Go to sleep.
They found my eyelash.
How was your evening?
Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
Everybody goes there.
You may as well invite her here.
Hello?
Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
Vincent...Vincent...
German, is that you?

Yeah.
Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
You worried about the cost?
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night?
No.
Have they found our friend?
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
Of course I think about it every day.
What happened?
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
And you got him...
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair done... the girl was slow.
It doesn't look like that.
Half a million.
What do you want for dinner?
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
After four years and now the question comes up.
It's just been a while.
$250,000 right off the top.
I didn't. I just waited.
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
They checked in.
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
Why didn't you tell me?
What do we do?
And switched keys.
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
We better stick here till tonight.
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
Chicago.
Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
Just sandwiches...
Don't you want to go to the airport?
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
You're going to have to walk back to the border.
Did Eric Pake pull her?
Well, he drove it into the river.
I made a mistake.
What name?
Jack, you're wrong.
Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
She's nothing to do with me.
What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
I want to talk to you later.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
Yes.
You know Sid Fletcher?
You know Sid Fletcher?
Go on.
Really?
He was here for four days.
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
Nasty.
Brumby.
Expect so.
Did my brother Frank find out?
Now tell me the truth.
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
You coming to South America?
Did they give you a rough time?
My brother, Frank.
Is he staying the night?
They came back?
What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
What's that supposed to mean?
No. I'm visiting relatives.
A bereavement. A death in the family.
Very...  So, who you working for these days Eric?
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow.
Eric told me of your bereavement.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.
Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it.
Three hundred altogether?
I'd never try to sell an Indian.
You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"
You had one you'd know it.  Patel. They keep coming up.  I don't know. They like to talk to salesmen.  They're lonely, something.  They like to feel superior, I don't know.  Never bought a fucking thing. You're sitting down "The Rio Rancho this, the blah blah blah," "The Mountain View--" "Oh yes.  My brother told me that..." They got a grapevine.  Fuckin' Indians, George. Not my cup of tea.  Speaking of which I want to tell you something:  I never got a cup of tea with them. You see them in the restaurants.  A supercilious race.  What is this look on their face all the time?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Their broads all look like they just got fucked with a dead cat, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't like it. Christ...
We're stuck with this...
Eh?
I...
Eh?
...that's right...
...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
That's thinking.  Now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself.  He's...that's what I... that's thinking! "Who?  Who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who?"
So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
The nurses?
With River Oaks?
You...
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
What do you mean?
Huh.
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
Yes.
You didn't?
Yes.
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
...I thought that we were only talking...
Me?
That's ridiculous.
Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?
That's...
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?
...what am I going to do all month...
Yeah.  That's swell.  Another waste of time.
Who used to say that?
I don't know, George, why?
Shelly: get in the office.
Williamson...Williamson, they stole the contracts...?
Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch...
I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...
...and I'm going to get bounced and you're...
You know what those leads cost?
The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your "end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed.  You hear me?  I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...?
Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
They took the phones...
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
Home...
Oh!  For the magazine...
No, his wife is.
Yeah.
Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them?
Three days.
To change our minds.
Three business days.  They mean three business days.
I don't understand.
If we wait till Mon...
What was yesterday?
Tuesday.
What's going on here?
...what, what, say it.  Say it to me...
Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.
What?
Guess what the Machine did?
Eight units.  Mountain View.
Yes.
We had a slight burglary last night.
Do you like them?
Did you see my present for you?
I know.  How long will you be gone?
I can't.
Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the &quot;Genco Olive Oil Company.&quot;
Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.
You're not my father!
Is Kay coming?
No.
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
Would you like some?
Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose.
Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie &quot;Five-Angels&quot;...thought you were never coming West.
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
It's the way Pop wanted it.
I know what you are thinking, Vitone, but you don't understand yet how things are.  Fanucci is of the Black Hand.  Everyone in the neighborhood pays him, even my father.
No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
I'm going to see my parents.
The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago.
But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
Go on, tell me.
And Kay...she's all right?
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
That's my brother.  Nothing could get him away from that two mule town.  He coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own Family.
Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The little guys got knocked off.  If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
Is he related to the witness?
Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through.
How's the baby?
Why don't you sit down?
At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.
Who's asking?
You said you were Klingman.
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
There are still things I have to do.
Alright.  They bother me once in awhile.  Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?
However I can help you...
We do favors for each other...
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  It's always been that way, most men frighten easy.
The money was sent.
Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
I know it wasn't me...so that leaves you.
Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?
I just left our friend in Miami.
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last.  Let me run my family without you on my back.  I want them taken care of.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.
They're still on the property. Maybe you better stay inside.
I'm talking about Italians!
What about Michael Corleone?
How much more a month?
Excuse me, I hope I am not a disturbance, Don Corleone.
I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
So what did you think?
What's to be jealous of?
You liked it too.
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?
Something I can do for you?
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
No!
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
"Frankenstein" and "Bride of" and "Son of" and all the rest?
All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough.
It's new.
We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders.  Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
Sorry.  Not today.
Do you miss it?
I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world.  Yes. I wish I had done more work.
Run for what?
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
All right.  Let's take it off now.
Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms.  Won't they be surprised?
Look, if you want to die do it yourself!
Calm down, Clay.  Just calm down. We'll watch it.
You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay.
She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.
You remember how a production eats up one's life.
You didn't, Jimmy.
You only embarrass yourself.
That's as good a way as any to describe it.  I've seen far worse cases.  You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.
Which ones?  I bring them all.
Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay?
How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"?
Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --
It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
What rumors might those be?
Can that count as one question?
Universal wanted me for another story, and wanted me so baldly -- I mean badly, not baldly.  I was given the pick of stories being developed, and I picked that one.
Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
Get out of here, Ray --
How is he?
Let's get out there. And have them run down every 167 Shelby Mustang in the area ... Find out where they're at.
Kip.
You know my back.
I'm on the move -
I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ...
What for?
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
Peugot convertible ...
No. That was Higgins ....
How you doing, man?
Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
Dignity...
We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...
That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving
Have you seen him?
I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
Hey, Kip, what's up?
"Over--"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
Shadow games ...
I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
Call 911 -
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
Hey.
No ... ?
She was so great, why'd you leave her?
I think so... They're just... So ...
What about The Club ... ?
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
And the moral of that story is -- ?
I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is now...
How old are you now, Toby?
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
The guy from near where Christie used to live?
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
Stop! Stop!
It'll be okay.
Get packed.  We're getting out of here.
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
Paulie was just talking about him.
Give'm a drink.
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
What'll I tell Fran?
I want to talk to Jimmy.
I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. :
Yeah, yeah.
Jesus! You must think I'm dumb. What are you bugging me for? I know what to do!
Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?
He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
No way! You're kiddin'!
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
Is that true?
Yah, all right...
Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?
It's a good thing no one's Irish here.
Me and Bill scraped together the parts, worked on it. Morgan was out panhandlin' every day.
Will you take a check?
To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.
That's one aspect of what we do.
That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't "why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?"
Seven.
Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing...
No, there's a limit.
What's your name?  Don't you walk away from me. This is people's work, you can't graffiti here.
This rectangle is subdivided into rectangles. One edge of an inner rectangle is an integer. Can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer?
Shall we start the, uh...
Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.
Then don't set up any more meetings.
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?
I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule.
Why me?
I need someone with your kind of background.
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
Just meet with the boy once a week.
Why would he do that?
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
What problems does he have, Sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with--
Oh, that's nice--
If you push him into something, if you ride him--
Where're you going?
About thirty million to one.
What's the point?
Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had the same problems as "Chad" the stockbroker.
You're right. I know.
No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
Well, I can see this is pointless...
Have you read all these books, Will?
No.
Maybe you married the wrong woman.
I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?
You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
How'd it go?
Why not?
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
You don't regret meetin' your wife?
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
When did you know she was the one?
That's right.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not...
That's what you want?
When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
Sounds good, where are you now?
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
No I haven't...
No I wasn't...
How was that?
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
It was great. There was always someone to play with, give you advice.
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian.
I've never seen your place.
What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
Come one Will. I just want to know.
No.
But it ain't runnin' away, Ma. All I wanta do is go away with another fella an' look aroun' for work by ourself--
That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
What's it to you?
Want to work?
How many men?
Women?
Two.
Say, who runs this place?
*You* find out, I can't.
Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.
Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.
They're all gone--or dead.
This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?
Gimme that gun. Now git outa here. Go down in them willows an' wait.
I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?
Try an' tell 'em, Tom. They'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone. An' you know what that is? That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five!
Can't tell if you hear it or not. You hear it, Tom?
They shore don't waste no time!  Take her out.
For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.
I stay in my own yard.
You ain't got to get sore.
Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
Yeah.
What you mean?
Workin'. Pickin' peaches. But I seen a bunch a fellas yellin' when we come in, so I come out to see what's goin' on. What's it all about?
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
What's the matter, Grampa?
Ma. Pa.  Grampa, his eyes hurt and hunted and frightened and bewildered, scratches in the dirt.
No plants.
Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.
You an' me's goin' together--jus' you an' me. We're a-goin' to that dance an' we're a-goin' to jus' set an' watch. If anybody says to come dance--why I'll say you're poorly. But you an' me, we're gonna hear the music an' see the fun.
Thank God. Oh thank God.  Tommy, you didn't *bust* out, didya? You ain't got to hide, have you?
Muley tol' me what happened, Ma. Are we goin' to California true?
Wait. There's a half a bottle a soothin' sirup here.  It put the chillun to sleep.
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
Didn' you get no sleep?
She shore don't look prosperous. Want to go somewheres else?
I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
They know he got hit in the face.
It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
That Casy. He might a been a preacher, but--he seen a lot a things clear. He was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too.
Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
Fact of the matter, Muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. It don't even break even, much less show a profit. One man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. You just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop.
Then who *do* we shoot?
That's Connie Rivers with her. They're married now.  She's due about three-four months.
Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
We gonna stay, ain't we?
Maybe it's nice on the other side. Them pitchers--them little pos'cards-- they was real pretty.
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
Now you done it! You busted it!
We can pick anything.
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
You're so funny...
So, what are you doing now?
I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
That's it?
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
Flowers. That's funny.
...Let me get my coat.
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
Like love?
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate.
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
Say more.
Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
I work alone.
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.
We can't do our job unless he does his job.
Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
He's falling for her. Look at him.
Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.
If he does our job, he's our job.
This?
That's going to cost.
Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
So what happened to you?
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
No. You drove us here.
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
I'm a professional killer.
Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
Are you shy, Mr. Booker?
How did you meet her?
Why didn't it work out?
Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful place.
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
Summers are short here, Annie. There isn't much of a fall. Before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long.
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
What about him?
Whatever you want.
You should call your dad before it gets too late.
You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom!  You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
He's still sitting in that damn field.
Did he mention it?
Grace, I don't hate your father.
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
What?... Oh baby...
That's not true.
What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim?
David?
Who's there?
What the hell does that mean? How much more do I have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me?
It's me.
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.
How are you feeling about work?
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
You want to take a walk with me?
She calls him Tommy...
Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
Sounds like something Tom would say.
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?
Maybe we should give him another sedative.
Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
Yeah?
I won't tell you it'll stop feeling this bad... But I can tell you, you didn't do anything wrong... The same thing would have happened to me... or Frank... or Joe... And there's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen...  I used to try and... always came up short. I don't think the why so's important as... what we do with what we get. I remember this boy I'd see up on the Blackfeet Reservation. He was sixteen. Great kid. Strong. He'd gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock. Snapped his neck, paralyzed him... After the accident, I'd look in on him from time to time... and he wasn't there anymore. His mind, his spirit, whatever you want to call it, it just disappeared. And what was left was nothing but anger... It's like the boy I knew just went away somewhere...
I can't... not yet...
I thought your mom's coming up?
My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
Honey, you all right? Did something fall?
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
What are you looking at, young man?
Does a horse miss a saddle?
What do you mean?
It's cool!
That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.
What?
Hold on a second!
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
Damn!
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey's bust?
Yeah?
Who's that?
Yeah, mom?
Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
Yes!
What?
You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
I'll make it up to you!
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
What?
Oh, wow, she's great.
I can't believe they decided you won.
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
Hello?
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and overlay files.
Die, dickweeds!
Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me. I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking around...
I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans.  I just hacked into it.
Hello, operator services.
What number please?
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
What?
This morning.
Is there another key?
What does that mean?
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
Sure it is. I think tonight Brady was ready to make a commitment.  But now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because I have to baby sit tonight.
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
Double scoops?
Come on Rachel.
Jamie, what happened?
Can we go home soon Rachel?
What are you doing out here alone?
Then we'll be safe?
You knew. You just didn't care.
You know Rach, Discount Mart is having a sale on Halloween costumes.
Where are you going?
Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.
Gods Country, Promise Land. Where are you heading Mr..ah
Car trouble?
Okay.
Jamie! Get away!
You blame everything on kids.
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
We just talked.
What time?
Shit!
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
Hello?
Why did you hang up on me?
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
You still spooked?
You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
I don't want to.
Want a beer?
You have the wrong feeling.
I found the car! He's here!
Yes, I am.
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
Right.
I promise.
Who is it?
Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.
Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
I see.
Pull up to the entrance!
Well, let's do it.
Well, I live downtown.
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
Mm-hm.
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
You're Holly.
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
Yes.
Like what?
How ya doin', man?
Yeah?
Child molestation is a touchy subject...
...with the affiliates.
Really?  So, so, what else?  Wh- what are you up to?
Yes, I do.
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
Oh, yeah.
Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived.
Well, what?  What, wh-what are you not telling me?
Well, what do you do?  Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what?  Do you, do you, do you phone them?
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
Hi.  How's she doing?
Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?
Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER  You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
Me?
Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten.
I can't take this anymore.
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
Yes, please.
No.
Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
Yes!
Oh, yeah?
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
Glad you could put in an appearance.
Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
Mh-hm.
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
You promised to stay on the wagon.
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
I know.  H-how much do you need?
Okay.
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Ouch!
Well, how about this?
Yeah, can you believe it?
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
W-why?  You don't think it's realistic?
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
Awwww...
Boy--
Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging.
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
Oh, so loosely.
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
No!
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
Yeah.  Me, too.
Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.
...in a really horrible way.
Well...
Have you?
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
No, I am.  I am.
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
Really?
I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year...
Well, what about me?
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.
Hi.
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.  I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I--
Take our literature...
...and I want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..
I have not read you your rights.
...you...
He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.
Why me?
Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
Then who's buying it?
Brigham.  Go.  Affirmative.  Okay, Happiness is a Green Light.  We've got Evelda in the kitchen, cooking.  The dope's D.E.A.  <u>We</u> want her on Interstate Transportation of some firecrackers.  Starling:  you've got Drumgo, you know her from before.
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
...he was <u>wealthy</u>...
...are they hard to get?
Hold up a minute...
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
Seen what, sir..?
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
...thank you...  And how are you this evening, Doctor? No, we know that you're awake...
Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
And how would you know that?
No, I think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates.
Oh, yes, what?  You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
..suitcase...locker...
For a consideration.
...what'm I looking at...?
I know you did what you could.
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
And how good of <u>you</u> to remember it. Then, this trip, then, is not a return to <u>America</u>...
How could you know?
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
I'd like to walk home with you, and...
We got KittyKat...
Yes.... yes...
Well, I don't want to starve them too long.  They die.
And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
No, I don't get you...
I came to pay my...
The girl needs help.
And what would be of Greater Help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence.  DON'T YOU THINK?  IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND UNIMAGINATIVE, DON'T YOU <u>THINK</u>?  BLIND HIM AGAIN, AND PREPARE <u>HIM AND HER</u> FOR THE PIGS! 
Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...
Because you're going to help me plan a party.
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
I don't understand.
"Because we don't have any money."
Hello....?
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
I want the money.
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
What're they on about?
Tell me why...?
...no...
...no.
How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
My encounter.
Call me conservative, but I'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry's lovely visage.
I hope so...
Freeze!  You're busted!
Yeah, an insane female gynecologist! Hayley, don't listen to her.
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
I have to get up. Still more to do. That boy hates Asian people. That girl thinks she gave her Mom cancer by dropping a plate on her hand. Her daddy touches her. His daddy never touches him. It would have been cooler if I'd died.
What in the hell did you do that for?
So this is it, anybody you don't agree about everything with can't be your friend...
I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
Fuck off.
Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in Kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray.
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
Come on Heather. We want another look at today's lunch.
J.D.? You seem pretty amused. I thought you were giving up on high school guys.
Don't worry. We'll work something out.
No.
Veronica, you look like hell.
Veronica. What are you doing tonight?
What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?
My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State."
Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
Like a suicide thing?
"You might think what I've done is shocking..."
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.
They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
We killed them, didn't we?
Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.
You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.
If you'll excuse me......
What did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?
That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.
Is it sleeping, dude?
Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
But my name's not...
I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
Come on through.
Look who I've found!
No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get fresh air or exercise!
He's the manager!
Come on, sit up.
I'm not hungry.
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
What does old Stew want?
The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!
turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.
He flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her!
Just a couple more . . .
Mummy!
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
It's inside a moving car.
I've got numbers to back me up. Over the course of one year more Americans die in car accidents than did during the entire span of World War II.
Sorry.
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
Must be nice.
GWEN?
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
Why don't you relax for the next couple of hours? Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that.
Get back here, junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking.
YOU'RE giving ME a speeding ticket? Mr. Mario Andretti himself?
Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?
You've been cheating on me haven't you?
What evidence?
I'll just stay out of this conversation until you come out and tell me why you've disrupted me at work.
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
-Tawny.
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
I just wanna talk with you for a minute.  Then you can jump.  You can jump twice for all I care.
I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...
Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!
I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...
Listen, John, you better double my attorney's fee.  She's very inexperienced, but she done a great job for me. And give her your autograph.  She thinks you're some kinda holy man.
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think.
Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you...
I took a loan on my car and my computer.
Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...
Mister LaPlante...
It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!  You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth--
Turn that thing off.
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
"Harassed."  Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  The guy's a thief, he took my...
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.
Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend?
Here we are.  Yeah, that's a possibility.  A movie.  Now you gwan in, tell your mother I got you back on time.  Point that out to her. She was always on my case for stuff like that.  She's still like that, right?
Uh, er... I...
I... I know that, John...
Now you help me up.  Boy, you seem...  taller.  It must be psychological...  now that I know you saved my life...
Gale!  This is for you.  I want you to know I never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything.
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
This guy LaPlante won an award?
There could be problems with something like that Mister Wallace. What if...?
What?
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --
Is he like that in real life?  So gorgeous?
Hey, c'mon.
Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
Well, now, don't go creating some artificial environment for yourself.
<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
I found a cent!
I'm thirsty.
Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.
Did you hear what he said?
He made, you know, a remark.
Do you remember who gave us this?
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
Yeah, I guess it would be good for us to get away for a while.  Maybe Rudolf got the same idea.  Dogs need a change of scene, too, from time to time.
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
The cab's waiting!
Where should I hide the car keys?
His secretary just confirmed.
What -- what are you doing?
I get to the restaurant and he's not there. I waited for forty- five minutes.  When I called his office, his secretary said they thought I had cancelled.  I had cancelled!  Then I get back to my office and <u>Aranson</u> is waiting for me and he knows <u>everything</u>.
Honey, it's not the end of the world.  You'll call Lowenthal tomorrow and find out it was just a mix-up.  And if he's not interested anymore, then you'll find another company to go to maybe even your own.  You are free now, you are independent.
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
Do you see a man?
Really?
Did you find a sword?  An old sword?
A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
Tough.
We don't have any proof of that.
I think it was England.
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
Must you do that?
We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.
If it came down to it what would you do?
Yes.
You can go first.
I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
Sometimes.
Why?
I cannot explain.
Aye.
Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
Corpses?
Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
Who was that man last night?
Do you always walk around with a sword?
I'm interested in mythology.
You're twenty minutes late.
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?
Oh -- I almost forgot.  Your head.
It isn't over, is it, Conner?
I love you, Conner.
I'll no forget you.
I think he's dead!
The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith.  They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas.
You get anything on Smith?
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
The best.
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
The car.  All you want is the car?
Bullshit!
There's fuckin' blood all over you!
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
How about the cop?
Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
You're a funny guy, Talley.
Let me come get him.
My father needs a doctor.  <u>Please</u>.
I overheard him with the girl.
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
Mine, too.
You leave that gun alone!
Kevin, my father needs a doctor.
What happened?
Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.
I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police.  So far as we know, your children are okay.
That's enough.
Chief?  Mike said a young girl answered the door.
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.
She didn't answer.
Then get your men off the wall!  You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath!  I <u>know</u> this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
I want to know what in hell you're doing.
Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait.
What?
The kids are in here!
He has lots of disks.
I thought they locked you in your room.
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
Who are you?
Can we let go?  You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
These disks . . . where are they?
And four children?
Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
Their people?
What did you overhear?
I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us.
General, sir. I am glad to find you. I have found you some supplies.
We must go to the Diplomat.
What do you mean, General?
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
I am on a list! What list?
You lie.
You have no whiskey?
Let’s go, Jock.
Paul, how the hell are ya'?
Can we phone them in, Paul?
Perfect timing.
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
Who did you call?
Excuse me.
Our cards, please.
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
Was there blood?
I will need a suite.
The third floor are low class rooms.
Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
What about us?
Go to the roof now.
So where is the lamb?
You cannot go alone.
Yes.
Tell me what it was.
I want to know.
Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
He has taken the presidential suite.
Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
What are you doing?
I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?
When?
Paul. Are you alright?
Why the hurry, Roger?
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
Easy. You've got to keep still for a bit, the last thing we need is a coronary.
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
What are you playing here, Price?
Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
If there really is someone else in this house, I think the four of us can handle the situation.
I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.
'Less the place really is haunted.
I don't think so...
You hear somebody?
I was upstairs with Eddie --
-- you lose either way, Price --
I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
Fine with me. Just somebody then better go and round up Melissa Marr.
-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --
Evelyn... Get up... NOW!
I was in the middle of --
Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top?
I think...I may have the answer.
Yeah. Why's there five checks? There's only four of us.
Sorry.
Good way to get your head blown off.
-- confirming everything we already know --
The lockdown thing.
There is something very not normal going on here!
-- Eddie!!
Please.....anyone....help me?
For the love of God....please...?
It doesn't say.  But that's not what interests me.  There's no death certificate for the daughter.  Anywhere.
May you find the peace you've sought in vain for so long.
What do these ingredients mean?
Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?
She's down...
She's here.
Look daddy!  It's empty!
Good night Angel...
Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
I just, I don't know...
It was in the cellar.  Weird.
I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
She's gone!
We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!
Not at all.  I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.
Maura.
Maura.
How long will it take!
Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?
I know what I saw.
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
What will he do?  What does he want?
It was off the statue.  In the club.
... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my customers.  Have you tried ...
No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...
Yes really.
You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...
Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...
What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
Not quite.
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
The song's over!  Come on! "You could be swinging on a star."
Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.
You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"
That was close....
Welcome to Rome, sir.
How.
Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word "Fuck" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on "America's Funniest Home Videos."
Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
You better believe I can.  I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do.
I hope you know what....
We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.
Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
That New-York-Italian-Father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch.  What was our bet?  A million?
You certainly do.
I hate a man with a sense of humor.  While you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt business deal.
If you do anything to my friend...
...But I guess you don't really know him any better than that board does, do ya, Miss Archuh?
I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy.
Adenoids?
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
Not at all. You're light as a feather.
Hungry, anyway.
Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
...I'm sorry.
...Certain people are --
Oh yes! In Muncie!
Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
Now, Aim --
I can't print this!
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
You can't print that!
I got big ideas, though!
Terrific.
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
This I know, Benny.
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life!
Wuddya mean, buddy?
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
But, Buzz --
Yes sir...
Yeah?
...Well, I'm not sure where I --
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
Well, I'm a college graduate --
But, sir! --
Not that way! Through the door!
...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours.
Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
There's one in every story.
Where?
At the Houmfort.
You mean Mama Rose was like Mrs. Holland?
No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
Believe me, Mrs. Rand, he doesn't do this often. This is the first time I've seen him --
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
You don't believe in it?
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
I've never heard of a cure.
Is this disease common in the tropics?
I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
Can't I take it for you?
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
You didn't find your patient so frightening in the daylight, did you?
I heard about your little misadventure yesterday, Miss Connell.  On your first "day off," too.
I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
All that you say comes down to the same thing.  You are asking me to pass a sentence of life or death on my own wife.
Dr. Maxwell is right, Mother.
I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.
That isn't true.  You never understood her.
OK, OK, the defense rests.  Want another?
I wasn't star--
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
I'm, uh, going to bed.
Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
I know, I know. I had no idea --
I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --
You're not going to --
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
Nah.
I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice, you know --
But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --
That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --
It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties.
What?
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
You want coffee or something?
That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
Nobody.
Mikey Williams?
Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?
Educated guess.
Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?
In many ways, the church-bound tradition of the father, son, and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent-child-adult triad within us all. It's a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology.
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
Arise and shine, young Hood.
I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
Awesome sleet and rain.
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
Truly? Do speak.
How do you know this shit?
Want some gum?
You're parents at that party?
You get in trouble?
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
Charles.
I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?
May I operate your telephonic apparatus?
Charles, what time is it?
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
Mikey was looking for you.
Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.
All my model planes.
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
One more shot?
Huh?
Didn't want to miss anything.
I had him!
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
He would have liked that.
You know I remember that.
One word to I.A. and he walks.
I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.
Fred Duggar?
Did you love her?
I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
Stuff.
You're not missing much.
I was her best friend.
You gave her gifts.
No back-up.
You're not following procedure.
We had feared we were the only ones...
What are we?
If you say so. You are innocent.
We want no quarrel with him.
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
Your melancholy eyes...
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
Is that supposed to frighten me?
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
Don't Louis --
He jests.
We're immortal. You've always known that.
Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.
Louis, look at me.
How do I look?
This is no performance.
That's not so.
Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
How do you mean, start?
Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
But why do you want me?
What have I done?
I know. It gets cold so fast.
Fascination...
Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.
Paris? You came from Paris?
Tell me about him. You must have lernt something from him! It had to happen for you as it did for me!
I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.
What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.
See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it?
You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
How did you do that?
What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
You loved your wife, surely.
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
Get lost, you scared me.
Yes.
Yes.
It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.
Be careful, Julie.
I'm holding your hand!
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
I understand something.
Checking the locks again?
Don't kill me --
Julie! Wait! You okay?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend.
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.  I'm going to take a walk and dry off.
Come on. We're gonna be okay.
He's in it with Willis?
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie?
Julie, is everything cool? Karla said...
How much?
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
We will see who is the first to die.
I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes.
All the graves?
I'm afraid so. There were rumors ——people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn.
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
I know it must be hard. But you have relatives in London --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --
Cathy —- how does it feel to have a father?
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
That should decide it or you --
Yes?
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep —- I want to avoid it.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live —- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
Theodosia.
Your daughter is ill.
She is not there. The coffin is gone.
I can't understand that.
I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
I can't.
Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? You have no family –– no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.
Get that ladder up here.
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here?  Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .
I can't fly. I haven't got any wings.
What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey.
Well, naturally. Of course.
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
Hello, Joseph, trouble?
Well?
Want to give my flower a drink.
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.
Will you try to get some sleep?
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Came back three days ago.
Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?
You want a martini?
Well, no younger than I was.
Still after that first million before you're thirty.
What do you mean, and be bored to death?
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
Hello.
Old Building and Loan pal, huh . . .
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?
George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there.
Those Rockefellers!
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
Well, what about all your other friends?
Eighteen.
Have you made up your mind?
Yeah, just started.
Where's your coat and hat?
You forgot something.
You can?
Great!  Find one for me.
I don't know.
N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
What is it?  What's there?
Happy to do it.
If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
Well, what the hell -- might be something worth seeing.  Take it somewhere and see if there's film in it....
You're too close.  Back off.
I'm going.
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
Too late, it's written.
Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence?
This is a mammal, not a fish.
Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
Where the hell were you?
Late.
Do I have to talk to those two?
Hey!  That's my boss!
It's good with coffee.
Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
Nothing, huh?
Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?
Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....
Hello, hello.  It went well, I thought.
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
I know, I know....
Bullshit.
10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
Did he raise the Kids?
Hi Dad.
Waiting for Andy.
I don't care.
Do I have to play with the little kids?
Yeah.
You're going sailing.
Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
It hasn't adjusted.
It's Miller time!
You buying?
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying.
Michael, the sub's dead.
Make up your mind.
You all right?
Michael...
Sounds wonderful.
How's your patient?
Mmmm... you smell good.
I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
Come on.
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
Who's going to do it?
Me.
But you --
Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.
Unhappy combination.  Most likely one's inside the other.
You look like an orange worm.
Lunch for Whitey.  Something to munch on in case things get dicey.
Why?
Not at all.
Somebody could have gotten hurt.
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
She, Mister Hutton.
When did this happen?
Yeah, from Boston.
Massachussettans aren't.
Sean, do you have herpes?
Besides that.
The one that goes underwater?
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
Now what's this do?
It's okay, Sean.
Take it up.
Take it up!
The space shuttle has landed!
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
What kind of trouble?
Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?
Who's grown up?
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
She still talking to you?
Thea....
Daddy, why can't I...?
Then don't come any closer.
I have work....
The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock....
You knew...?
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
Whatever happens next.....
Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
We'll be there....
We have three months of work and approximately no money left to support it....
Ask the big doctor about his work.  Tough life you Bahamian beach bum... Playing in the water all day....
Don't be late.
I like Grandma's cooking....
Your father was six then.  Just like you....
I almost forgot....
It came for him.  It waited all this time and it came for him....
Sit down, Ma....
Oh, it looks like my uncle's.  He taught me how to sail when I was a kid....
Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....
You're not a pain in the ass....
You look tired....
What are you doing?
A drink with an umbrella in it....
I could take some time off....
You sure you don't need glasses?
When we find her we'll radio her position...The Coast Guard will pick her up.  Don't worry....
Grab your socks....
You sure you know how to do this.
Jake tells me you're going to have to fly for the rest of your life to pay off what you lost at the crap table....
I want you to leave her alone.  I don't want you involving her in....
I don't know what the hell to say....
Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?
Feathers all over the place....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
Forget it....
Money is money....
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
How long?
Who?
Maybe the gear crapped out....
A Moray eel...A Moray eel....
What the hell are you doing?
Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....
Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....
How much longer?  This is supposed to be your party.
Here it comes....
More beautiful with each passing minute...
When he has a pillow over his head....
No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-
Yeah?
We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs?
How's the new residence?
Because, don't get into it ...
Maybe?
Someone bet me a dollar ..
We're going.
Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..
Pay me, and I shut up.
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.
God, it pisses me off, Ross.
Just makes to so God damned mad ..
That's a very stupid question, Ross.
Yeah .. I guess she's in the kit- chen .. We got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey ..
Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
Bits.
Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..
You ain't going in alone?
Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?
No, Sir.
That's bullshit,
And did they?
Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.
As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber?
The elevator wasn't working?
I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
Are you wearing a uniform?
No.
Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
Do you pray?
Really? What did he say?
You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?
It's not possible right now.
Why does he want to kill me?
I know about alcohol, John.
I think they're gonna arrest me.
Interview over, Blattis ...
.. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do ..
Yeah, I guess I do.
You want something, darling?
Shut up, King Jay ..
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
Listen to me!
I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.
Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party.
Can I help?
Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
Hmm.  Pretty good.
Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.
Thanks.
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
I'm working with you because of that memo...
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
Fine, I just --
What --
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room.  Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you.  I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you.  I missed my wife.  We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh --  I love you.  You complete me.
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
I heard.
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity.  I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball." That's New York Steak, baby.  Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS.  Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!!
Rod --
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
Is that your porty or mine?
You're telling me to dance.
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.
Forget it.  Forget it.
No, I don't know.
Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man.  He's gonna get me killed.
Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
Gorgeous.
Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?
Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
I don't see any.
What's going on, Jerry?
He should have kept his head tucked down.
Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
Nothing.
What did you say!
Eric! Are you here?
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
You had the phone the whole time?
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
Hmm?
A well-accepted theory.
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
Know what this is?
How much of this island have you explored?
It's strikes me now I never told her that.
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
I have never been on this island!
I don't believe you.
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
I've been putting this together for over a year.  I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people.  They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them.  Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately.  If we hesitate, all will be lost.
John . . .
Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
Hi, Dad.
I don't even know this woman.
Which one?
I could come with you.
Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
It has a broken leg!
Why did you come here?
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."
You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.
Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
Did I say jerk?
But with this place, I - - I wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  An aim devoid of  merit.
You're absolutely right.  Yes, you're right.  Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious.  	We're over- dependent on automation, I can see that now.  But that's all correctable for the next time around.
But you know, I should  really be the one going .
Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
They died together?
You've got a T-rex!?  He's got a T-rex!  A T-rex!  He said he's- -
Ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. They do move in herds!
Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?
Not just every six weeks.
- - a gizzard - -
They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
The fences are electrified, right?
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?
Yes?
Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
I read your book.
So am I going to help you with your foot?
Straight-A brainiac!
Come on, try some.  Take a bite.
Are you crazy?  What if you miss?  I hate it up here.
You got any kids?
Why?
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
Dad - - Dad - -
It's safe?
It's safe.
What if the dinosaur comes back while we're all asleep?
Shhhh.  Tim, I'm right here below you.  Easy catch. One, two, three.  You count it yourself.  One, two, three - -
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!
John, John.
I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
Thanks for the presents.
Hey Lex, ahhhchooo!  Hey Lex, com here.
That's not funny.
Okay... well... I think it's this way...
I didn't think there were any houses up here...
Who is this? What's going on?
I don't know...
What about that other guy?
He... he's here...
_Krueger_...
Sorry.
So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?
I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.
So?
None of that's true?
No. You've told me all I need to know.
The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
Insomnolesence...
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
Not yet.
This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical.
Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
Ten minutes...
You work in the insurance department?
Preliminary investigations may already be underway.
I don't know what you could have read.
An empty tomb?
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
Then its authority is in doubt.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
It's what I'm paid to do.
You wanted to see me, sir.
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
I -- I found your jailer.
This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment.
I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
-- Listen to me --
He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
I don't know.
Probably not.
My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.
Wait a minute.  "Raban?"  Where have I heard that name?
Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
What if I petitioned one of the Directors?
This is filed incorrectly!
We could go back to the office. Explain ourselves to the Chief Clerk.
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
I tell you it doesn't exist!
You are most kind. We will be proud to assist you!
Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!
Native costume?
What was it, Jack?
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
That's your monkey, Denham.
Set up the camera boys! Get a shot of me comin' ashore!
I'm calling a wrap. We're heading back to the ship.
What?
Haven't seen her - not since we got back.
Yeah.
Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
No, that's not --
Can't we talk together reasonably, just -- ordinarily?  I know you're expecting some kind of -- extravagant behavior, but believe me -- do you believe me? --
I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.
Mm.
A name. Grunemann. Nothing. And they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing. Then they asked me, well had I been getting letters, from someone out there in Cabbageville --
But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
You've changed your mind? You do want to play?
What do you think?
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
Well --
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.
How can you do it to yourself?
Ligourin: How could you do it?
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
Yeah.
I was wondering what that was.
Listen to me: It's all right. I've been expecting something.
Right back at the start, right?
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic?
About what?
Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.
Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
John, how are you?
I've just got a few --
Not unusual.
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
In real life when does he hit you?
No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
Mom, I mean dad...
Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and--
Salisbury steak.
Owwww...You're hurting me... You're hurting me...I hate you ...I hate you...
Yeah?
I'm sorry...
Daddy?
Objection.  You're leading the witness.
Wow!  That's neat.   Can I sit in it?
Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
Was there Burger King?
Why does he decide?
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.
Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?
Six years.
Did you wish to?
Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
Eight, almost nine years.
No.
A heavy drinker?
No.
We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.
How's the new job?
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
Okay, I'm here.  Now why did you--
Ted, when we got married it was because I was twenty-seven years old and I thought I should get married and...when I had Billy it was because I thought I should have a baby...and I guess all I did was mess up my life and your life and--
Me?  I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
'Night, Jim.
Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  I think they're kind of interesting.
I can't.  I've got Billy to take care of.
Right.
Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child?
How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son?
John?
How the hell are you going to do that?
What?!  She wants what?!
You ever see her talk to the walls?
But I'm going to have to take some stitches.
Mr. Kramer, there's--
Look, Ted, all I--
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
Got it.
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
Thelma, if I die--
Ted.
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
I am sorry, Lhamo.
Not the way to talk to people.
No.
I will buy them for you.
Goodbye, Kundun.
Are you, General?
I will not approve it.
General Chiang.
Ngabo did not have the state seal. He could not sign.
Oh, no. Where will he go?
I will be back in a few days.
How big is Tibet's army?
Will we be in this war?
Where is Alsace?
What can I do? I am only a boy.
I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.
Good day.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
I leave tomorrow.
What does the butter spot feel like?
And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
You cannot.
Ahh.
I will miss you.
Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
It is possible, Holiness.
It seems like we're getting lower.
Why are we landing?
And what would he do come winter?
Cocktail?
Is this a trick?
I can arrest you!!
No!
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
The more he thrashes, the better.
Where?  Where?
Thank you, Jack.
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
Nothing's real.
Eh.  Fuck it.
He's gonna live?
I <u>told</u> you.
How would <u>you</u> know, what--
It's too dangerous for--
You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
We might as well pack.
He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming?
Get him onto shore.
If I'm ever in New York...
Different worlds, Jack.
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
You said nobody came in here!
Now I'm gonna puke.
He's done.  He's dying.
It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
You think Jack's handsome?
Are you okay?
Hank!
I was working for you when "us" started, what's--
This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
Kelly--
Wild guess.
Boy, is that smart...
Well, except for the one girl.
Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?
Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises.
You're all right! Where is he?
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his "taste" - so to speak.
Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -
Not yet.
Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio, where the Bimmel girl was abducted. Blue triangle where her body was found - down here in Missouri. Same marks for the other four girls, in different colors. This new one, today... washed up here.  Elk River, in West Virginia, about six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies.
Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.
Why not?
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?
No way. She had a guy, I'da known, believe me. Sewing was her life, she was really great at it. Poor Freddie.
Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?
Sometimes you do.
Yes.
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.
Then please - do this test for me.
I never thought about it.
Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.
Quid pro quo, Doctor.
How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?
Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.
No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want?
I heard a strange sound...
But you could. You did.
The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...
Why didn't you bury those people?
Sorry to disappoint you...
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children.
"Justice"?  If that's "justice"..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.
He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?
What?!
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
Ottawa!
That is the truth!
I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.  No force on earth will keep me here... Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each man make your own decision... Those who are goin', be back here in an hour.
I'll cover them from the top of the casement.
Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
And what is that?
Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
What happened to you?
Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
Webb's at Edward?
Sir!
"Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness."
Yes.
Yes.
What is enough?
Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
Such as...?
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
Dead?  This morning you said he had some skin disorder.
It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
Be careful with it.
That's why there's a dead one on the ship.  It ran out of blood.
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
What are you doing?
Excuse me, sir...
No!
Okay, number 23's full.
Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
You take your money, too seriously, Bo.
Hey, Bo...when're you going to be off that thing?  I want to find out tonight's NBA scores and check the weather.
Listen to it for Christsake.
You let him get away!
Hey, man, you know that in Switzerland--and this country's the size of East L.A., okay?--they speak 54 different dialects? Fifty-four!
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
Burritos...Enchiladas...
Serves his ass right to get it.  Motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.
How far away is she?
Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick.  She's downstairs in the infirmary.
What are you going to do to him?
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
Tip top, Willie...tip top.
How much did you part with?
I wanted to talk to you about that.
Well, talk.
I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
It's a Samoan pub.
Like what?
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
How long has he been in there, son?
That's no way to answer the phone.
What can I do for you?
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
So do you know these geezers well?
There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.
J, what's going on out there?  Get the rifle out, Charles. We're being fucked.
Right, his leg's going now.
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.
There's nothing in it!
Well, what did he say?
Tom?
And?
Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
I can't help you, Plank.
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.
You know how much it is, Nick.
Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?
You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.
Oh, you assume, do ya? What do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuck-ups?
You would take a pain ín the arse full stop.
How many feet?
You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
--you're going to be on your own.
They're not going to jail.
How do you think you're going to make a living?
I am, sir.
Well?
Please.
I do, sir.
Yes, sir.
So you knew this young man before?
If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction.
I'm feeling okay--
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
Yeah, this is Skinny.
Everybody on the border knows that story.
You got a cause of death?
Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?
Colt Peacemaker.
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--
Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
You'll get official notification when I make my decision. He is out the door--Otis pulls himself a beer as Carolyn steps back out--
If it's too late--
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
So how come you got into all this?
Bird flying south-you think he sees that line? Rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. So why should a man?
Right.
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,
Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder.
I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part--
Seriously.
I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.
Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.
Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.
Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]
I thought you were married!
Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected.
They just wanted it to be one of theirs--
That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.
That so?
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
And Buddy was one of them.
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
There was a mandate in the last election--
Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
Why would I want to go there?
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in.
That was the night he disappeared?
Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.
Well, you were working there--
Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
Your mother still doesn't like me.
People liked him.
I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--
He hates me.
We thought we were something, didn't we?
How come it feels the same?
I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
Yeah?
Couple months before I was born--
I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--
The shooter local?
Just doing my job.
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
How'd you spell that again?
Right.
Who did this?
He's a priest?
What about death?
Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm.
I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.
Sorry.  You asked.
No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
So why did you marry him?
That's my business. Harry.
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
So Swann was performing magic. not illusions?  And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
Nothing?
I was so afraid.
Harry?
Don't look.
What about me?
... they believe you.
What were you doing up there?
Trickery and divinity.
Go away.
What are you, my mother?
Maybe I just bought it.
I saw him in Vegas once.
Are you a gambling man?
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
What for?  You need to stay busy?
Yes.
Was that Swann's idea?
I want to see Swann face to face.
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
What's her problem?
Yeah.  You could say that.
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
And he didn't have them?
Call me tomorrow.
What?
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
Swann?  What are you doing?
You could still help me do that.
Yes.
Yeah, they told me.
Ok.
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
How long have you been married?
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
Hi again, how's it going?
Oh, hi.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
Hey look, it's Sausalito.
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
No, yes, it does...
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
You think so?
Well... have a good flight.
Yes?
Alright?
What?
How do you say "hospital" in Japanese?
Evelyn Waugh?
I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink downstairs. She wants to talk about some photo thing.
No, what are you talking about.
I don't know what to do.
Hair stuff?
...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?
Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
I spaced out.
I'm still shaking.
I'm gonna have to get a restraining order.  What a nightmare.
Must be a spare set.
What a...jerk!
Nonsense, it's all of our home.  So how's work treating you?
What time did you make it for?
Your court order, Dr. Allen.
The doctor's concerned he may never come out of this dementia.
You killed my parents.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but I don't want to tell him. I'm RH negative.  My blood type is negative...  If he's RH positive, I'll have to terminate.
How many weeks are you honey/
And also that...
A narcissist doesn't admit it.  It's the extreme of self-denial.
You're sure?  There was nothing?
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
I don't understand what's going on.
And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  "The time of transformation is near..."
Are you alright?
Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.
How much time do we have?
Oh, Peter.
And what are you thinking we should do now?
You do know, don't you.  That these are also numbers.  Greek numbers, 600, 60 and 6 - or 666.  The sign of the Devil.
Good of you to stop by.
Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
Hey!  Mr. big shot.
Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.
nothing.
I can't eat before a game.
Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised to see you.
What?
Yeah.  Can't wait to see him  I just saw Quincy.
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
How is she alright looking the way she does?
Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.
What?
What?
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
Can I take your coat?
Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.
Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...
Nah.
No.
So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
I know...
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
He's in college?
Dad.  What are you doing here?
You shoot like a girl.
You were trying to make me look bad.
What's that?
How's that been?
One, up.
For real?
My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
I don't like flowers.
Oh.
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
And?
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
I can't be nice to a fan?
Forget Tonya Randall.
Then prove her wrong.
Why not?
Cheap date.
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
Look, I'm entering the draft.
Few days ago.
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
So...how's the knee?
Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
Maybe go back to school.
What?
You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't.
I'll play you.
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
Not great.
We were just studying.
Where's your dad?
Later when?
You scared me.
Sorry.  You okay?
I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
I'm also good enough to go pro.
No need for braces, Donnie.
THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSSINESS. I HAVE BEEN A GOOD WORKER, A GOOD AND LOYAL WORKER FOR YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
You ok?
And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
Does this sound weird?
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
Oh, she's fine.
It was scary though.
...what the fuck is this...?
What the fuck do you want?
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
Honey.
Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
-- do you wanna cup?
Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
Eight o'clock?
ok.
I'm sorry.
You don't how fuckin' stupid I am.
It's ok.
-- you the resident here?
-- can I get you?
What?
Can you hold it?
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
-- no.
It's ok --
I'm a rapper.
Finish it up without the lip.
What's up?
I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
Phil, hang in just one more minute ok?  I'm gonna put you on hold -- Doc you still there?
Is it real love?
What?  What does that mean?
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
Picky, picky.
Don't get strong, Donnie. This is making sense, this making a lot of sense. You are not doing the job, the job I ask you to do, a job I give you. Over and over and over and I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry that much more.
What is that?
Yes.
Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
...ah...
Time lines, y'know?  I remember things but not so -- right there -- y'know?
Go fuck myself?
...gimme that fuckin' phone...
This is so boring...so goddamn... and dying wish and all that, old man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing:
Do you know Lily?  Phil..do you know her?
Twelve.
I think you have the wrong number.
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
Not really.
Go ahead and waste your time.
C'mon, Frank.  What are you doing?
Where are you from originally?
Are you close?
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
Uh. huh.
I don't think, he can't...
What? What? What now?
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?
Yes I can, Marcie.  And until you start givin' me some straight answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.
--- What was that?
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
I won't.
You want her right now?
Are you alright?
I'm drinking.
I don't hate you, Jimmy.  But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask....
hey.
That's it.
She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her, in her head...
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
You deserve to die alone for what you've done.
Can I come in?
Want me to wake her up?
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
Do you have an agent, Stanley?
No.
They look pretty smart, I think.
You don't want any water?
Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.
Where will the money go?
Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.
Linda --
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
Hello.
You motherfucker...you motherfucker.... YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
-- what-what-what, ma'am -- I --
Pink Dot.
yeah.
We need more dog food --
Be ready at two --
I'm fine. nothing.
Yes.
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
I have money.
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...
I am preparing for a ball!
Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
Switch?!  That is your plan?  It is ludicrous!
He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
Aramis, this will never --
He seeks redemption.
Pull them back!
What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.
Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
You trust his character more than anyone else does.
It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!
He lies.  He is here to trap us.
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it.
I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --
Your Majesty...
It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?
At least help Raoul.
Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
... You knew you had a double?
You dead yet?
Who was Athos seeking?  Tell me! Did he try to enter the palace?
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
Exactly why it should be given away.
How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
Well don't you think that's odd?
Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection.
Outside hacker?  What the fuck are you talking about?
And who are you?
Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
And where the hell is Marvosa?
Where is he?!!
Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
If there's any doubt, we matched the indents of the bitemark on the note against the Smithsonian teeth. This is your boy...  He folded the bottom part, including what Lecktor tore out. In this enlargement of the back side, oblique light revealed impressions.  We can make out: 'six-six-six'.  I didn't spot it until I had this high-contrast print. I advised Chicago as soon as I saw it.
Read it.
I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
You look all right now.
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
What's one way?
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
It's the guard in the storeroom.
What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can: Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...
Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit...
Reba...
The developing room.  I need to... see you.
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
Yes.
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
Dr. Chilton.
How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
No. I can help you.
Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
And you said?
It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep.  I love you...
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.
I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
Blue is cold.
You haven't smoked in two years.
And... where are things?
I have to go back to Birmingham.
Is Crawford going with you?
Maybe we should give it some time...
Let's forget who said what to whom...
My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that little booger eat.  I'll bet he's gained ten pounds.  Molly's out in the motor home...
I know... 'Out in the good air...'
Thanks for the lift.
Yes. Who are you?
My name's Will Graham. I...
It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
What kind of coffee do you like?
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground.  I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face.  Never mind, it's boring.
Pray tell.
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
No.
You have to do it.
Are you makin' fun of me --?  This is RIDICULOUS!
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
But wasn't it funny?
That means it was a success.  I woke up the audience -- like punk rock!  Here, take this.
Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...
I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
Andy!
Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show!  It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.
Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married?
And all this will be for real?
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Sir, do you have a problem?
I was very original!
Get off my stage!  You're fired!
Uh, yeah.  Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO?
Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback.  God, listen to this!  "It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."
Hmph!  They sure didn't give Andy much to do.
If you get caught using that --
What are you doing?
How many were there?
How?
I got you.
The cubicle across from you is empty.
Do you still want to meet?
Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something.  What you know you can't explain but you feel it.  You've felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.  It is this feeling that brought you to me.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
Of the Resistance.
She helped you?
What did she tell you?
I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
But what?
Hello, Neo.
Who are you?
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
Gee-zus.
What?
How did you do that?
Who is?
Why?
What?
But an Oracle can.
Should I be?
What did she tell you?
Go!
I'm going in after him.
You can't!
I have to.
No, you... have to be.
What?
See who?
I'll be all right.
An Agent!  You have to send me back!
Look fella...this is private...
Riverdale.
Who's the girl?
Look at her.
You flew before?
Waddaya think?
You got some mouth!
You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it.
I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
Keep your mouth shut.
Shut up!
Take it.  I'm doing it for you, stupid!
Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
Oh Michael, look...
Charlie, this is business.
Uncle, how are you feeling?
Nothing.
Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
Please take it.
An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.
A paper on that one too?
Count it.
This is some boat.  Your father's?
I know...I know.
You mean it's heisted.
You could say that.
How about me?  I don't get a drink John?
Must have been all the liquor in him.
I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
Hi, everybody.  Sorry to be late -- had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief --
That was 'Joe'.
Have you got a minute?
Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?
-- Black.
It's for the party, Dad --
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
Yes, sir?
What are you eating.
How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
-- Did I hear 'business'?
Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
And what would that be?
Yes.
It doesn't matter.
Who are we talking about?
Perhaps you could remind me.
In my sleep.
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
Me, too.
'Joe...'
That's it?
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.
Yeah, that's what he said.
Don' be facety, woman.
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
Good morning, Jennifer.
Black.
Do I?  I'm a little confused.
I'm lost.
You act like you never had peanut butter before --
I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
Why?
Girlfriend?
You're here?
Well -- I --
We know all that we need to know --
But there's so much to tell you --
'Love will find out the way'?
No --
Joe, that's the kitchen.
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
Not at all.
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
It is a deal?
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
Why didn't you stop me?
Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
Why did you go to the hospital?
I guess...
Hello, Bill.
Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
I'm not hungry.
Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
You're what?
I think you heard me, Bill.
How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
Which is what?
You want me to be your guide --?
You fill the bill, Bill.
'Yes' what?
I think you know --
I don't!
What are you talking about?
Are you giving me orders?
What is this, a joke, right?  Some kind of elaborate practical joke? At my 40th reunion, we delivered a casket to the Class president's hotel room and --
About what?
I want to have a look around before I take you.
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
Drew told me.
I don't like to interfere.
What were you going to say?
So what's wrong with that?
What is it, Daddy --?
Then what is it?
This is crazy --
I love him.
You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --
My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
I agree --
I've got to go --
79.
Well, what then?
That's it?
I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
Shit. Wrong room.
So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
What?
Thanks.
Jimmy?
I don't want blood on them.
Then you shouldn't have to ask.
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
Somebody's come. Already.
You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you?
How?
Don't talk about my wife.
How do you know about me?
My boyfriend told me about you.
I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
It's good.
Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?
You don't know him?
Natalie? Natalie who?
Shut it, Teddy.
I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.
Unfinished business.
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -
It makes all the difference.					 *
To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many		    * guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G.
Bullshit.							*
...I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  We don't know who's straight up, who's not...
Okay.  You got the "item"?
My end?
What's "nothing"?
What do you like to drink?
How fast does that go?
It goes very fast.
You do business in Cuba with your husband?
Where's she now?
I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...
I forgot the napkins.
Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts?
When?
Is this the protective male talk?
...in the morning.
What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail?  You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?
You afraid of violence?
How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?
Packaging?
Yeah?
You got something to say, José, let's hear it.
Stevens?
So?
Anything?
Havana, Cuba...?
Hey, fuck him.
As in...?
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
Okay.  What's up?
Meet and greet.  "I flash you some of mine, you flash me some of yours?"
And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
Have faith.
Sonny...?
Who are you talking to?
Yeah.
What's it say?
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
I think José suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.  And people, who are good at what they do?  They have egos, too...
What would you do...?
You set this up!
What do you care?
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
You sure you heard what I said?
You ain't coming to work?
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?
Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?
For what?
Where'd that come from?
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
Don't say nothing about you either.
Don't need a comb.
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
I'm scared.
These guys're good drivers.
How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?
I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you?
Hell, don't cry about it!
What you got me up here for?
I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta have fifty-seven dollars.
Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?
You got it.
What?
For the money... )
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
Just what?
...are you with the Consulate?
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.
Just Erich.
And you?
That doesn't seem so bad.
You just got to get yourself a good lawyer.  And some money... Talk to Max.  He's been in the longest.
How long?
And?
You gotta be fucking crazy!  You got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in Section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs.
Yeah,  for the criminally insane.  I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time...
Then we're outside the kogus. Then what?
Oh we... we...
I want to cut his throat.
'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it.
Never was anybody like you...
Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.
You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. 
What'd the Prosecutor say?
Who got the Frenchman out?
Yeah...?
There's some weird shit here.
You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up.
What?
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
You feel anything?
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
"Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?
You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
What do you-?
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
Okay, meet me out front.  I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight.
Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
It didn't bite me.
You go first. I'll be right below you.
Talk to me.
Hello.
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
Sure.
Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't want to take up any more of your time. I best be going.
How long...?
Here.
I don't have a title yet.
But what?
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
My daughter must be going nuts.
I made you my speciality--scrambled eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page 75.
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
Then who did?
But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said "I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way."
Yes.
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
Misery's Return?
Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...
Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
Here, in case you think of any ideas.
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
"HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!"
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
...have to wait.
To celebrate Misery's return. I couldn't have done it without you.
Annie, what is it?
What?
I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
I know you do. I love you too, Annie.  And you're right. We are meant to be together. And I know we must die. But it must be so that Misery can live. We have the power to give Misery eternal life. We must finish the book.
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
What?
What thing?
Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.
So do I...
It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
Great.
Where is it?
Well that depends.
How I usually find you, Nyah.
You're not interested in seeing how it looks.
'Thief in the Night?'
To do what?
Sort it all out.
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
Package away in five..four..three.. two..one...
Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.
What are you doing here?
- torque wrench.
I wouldn't do that.
Indeed.
Your help?  What are you talking about?
Awfully short notice..
Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you.
I want <i>you out of there.</i>
How do you suggest I go about it?
Like what?
What did you think of him?
- is where Miss Hall comes in.
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
..not in time to save him.
Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure..
Ethan, I keep telling you there's not a chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there's not a chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up and running!  How much time does she have left?
A visit from an old friend.
So what do you suggest?
Maybe we donít have to know what he looks like.  If heís got that list, heís going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops.
Two minutes til Krieger shows.  Thisíll have to be quicker than Iíd like. Certainly quicker than youíd like.
Krieger.
Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the car.
Take off your coat.
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
The message is for Job.
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
Theyíre dead.
Yes.
Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.
Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
What about Job?
Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
Would you remove your hat please?
Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.
A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing.
Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Iíll call you from Paris.
Of course I can hear you.
I don't like him.
Where you been?
You did this once it didn't work out.
He got hit by a bus.
Who is this man? You're engaged!
I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other.
We're supposed to do fifty apples. We only got twelve done.
It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.
How many men since then?
Just Johnny.
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
That light.
I've never seen a moon like that.
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
Why not?
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
Hi.
I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
Kinda gaudy.
Thank you!
It's the best thing there is.
Yeah.
And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?
I'm really afraid.
No.
You've gotta get outta here.
Bye, Aunt Rita.
Yes?
Seven-thirty.
There's one thing about this wedding I want you to do. Call this number. It's a business number. Ask for Ronny. Invite him to the wedding.
I can't. I need my family around me now.
Johnny, I have something to tell you.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here!
No.
Why not?
I'm thirty-seven years old.
And we'll sell the house.
Hi.
A wife knows.
He's with his dying mother!
Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
We just come from the bank.
Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?
I know.
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
Who was that?
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
That's it! That's the reason!
Sure!
Do you have a girlfriend?
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
Yes.
I'm a little cold.
I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
I don't know.
She's got it.
We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.
Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ...
No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
Please, please good people.  I am in haste.  What knight lives in that castle?
Who are they?
NI!
All right!  What do you want?
Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
Come on then.
Had enough?
What are you going to do. bleed on me?
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
Are you sure he's got one?
Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?
Who ... Who breaks out?
Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
Ni!
We shall attack at once.
Who are they?
A G...g...g...
There.
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
Yes.
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
Make a bridge out of her.
He will be soon. He's very ill.
I'm getting better!
I feel fine.
Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
'Ere.  He says he's not dead.
At last!   A call!  A cry of distress ...  Concorde!  Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain!
Farewell, Concorde!
One day, lad, all this will be yours ...
But, Mother ...
I'd rather ... just ... sing ...
But, Father.
You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
No ... just keep him in here.
Why?
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
Back to your bed!  At once!
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
Hurry!
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
I done it again.
So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.
How much?
How about yourself?
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges.  It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it?  Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys.
I'm getting dressed.
I've got my duties to attend to.
I can't move to tidy.
Mr Brown, sir --
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
What did you say?
And that is my last word on the matter.
We --
How will I know?
How will I know what she requires?
I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
I thought I made myself perfectly clear.  You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it.
Go inside at once.
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
You sent for me.
I'm fine.
I wouldn't know.
They don't see it.
No loyalty.
She'll think I betrayed her.
Aye, ma'am.
Archie.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside --
For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
I came as quickly as I could.
What can we do?
Then they may read about me.
This is my good John Brown.
The question is, do we need her?
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
Who?
What's her excuse this time?
A fine choice, sir.
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.
I understand he was in a fight.
Has he been hurt?
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
Who told them that?
What do they want?
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
He is sick, ma'am.
If I tell you, then it's no fun.
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...
The next half of the game takes place in ARCADE's brain, The City of Truth. It's urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete. Screamer comes faster here.  On Level Four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world.  Gotta time it right though.
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
Maybe he's not dead.
Did you play ARCADE last night?
So where is he?
It is.
What?
Go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. And make it quick, okay?
You got the schematics?
Alex...
And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
You don't get it, do you?
I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.
We can't reach that!
And then keep on driving?
Can you say anything but "cool"?
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
It's been a very strange day.
So what's the problem?
We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
Your Aunt called me.
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
There was an accident. I came here.
What?
Yes, there was.
What's wrong?
Okay... but just...just to see.
"I can call them... I can call my dad... "
"Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... "
And who are we auditioning for today?
Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
Hardly.
Not a coke or anything?
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
I'm not listening.
What's the trick here ?
So why this ?
Why did you build this whole place ?
I was lured by all the money and I truly did convince myself that what I did was for justice. Since then, McCay has wanted to put anyone he can down here.
Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
What do you mean ?
What do you do with the company, if I might ask ?
Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.
Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
Where are we going ?
I see here that this guy has made deposits into his own account for the last four months. Each one in the amount of $100,000. He then puts in deposits into his girlfriends account.
Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
Excuse me, sir ?
If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?
Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive.
I am thirty two.
I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
Hey, Mr. Executive. Buy you a drink sailor ?
Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
Then what do you want ?
What is Bruce doing ?
What's next ?
Look he figured it out !
Well, I make good investments, I lead a double life as a secret agent.. I....I ... I have very rich parents. I have always had a lot of money.
You don't have to sound so emphatic.
I want to go to sleep for about a month.
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
Hey good lookin' ! What'cha got cookin' ?
Are you writing a poem?
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
My only problem is that your Uncle Phil is giving me five bucks to pick you up but I don't get paid 'till delivery.
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room.
Thanks, I needed that.
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
I will. How's Shelly?
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
We have a baby?
Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Never heard of him. 
How about a nice glass of milk?
She can spread her wings, right here in Pennsylvania. You don't send a child alone to Los Angeles, she could come back with her ears pierced, her legs shaved and God knows what else.
I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.
Maybe he's wet?
Umm...can you come in for a minute?
Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
It's just a corpse.
What are you staring at?
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
I guess you have.
Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
Vada.
Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?...It smells like someone left their gym bag in here.
Boyfriend?
Uh oh...
What's he smoking?
And you'd be my cousin?
Yeah I guess...sort of.
It's not his fault!
Nick?
Some sacrifices are worth it.
They're great.
Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?
What's with the touching, why was he touching you?
Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
When did you umm, I mean umm...
Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
What's this? December 8th, 1958?
Shelly?
He is?
I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.
Good for you baby.
Wanna play?
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
Ex...ex, ex...
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
Yes.
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
They're dead?
You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
Harry, I really think she.....
Hi.
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
Kinda like men.
I had a good time tonight.
Yeah.
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
Rock?
Want to what?
I ahh, better go.
Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?
I love this guy! 
The money?
When?
When??
Hi.
He was allergic to bees.
Oh come on.
How much does it cost?
Thirty five dollars.
Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.
Who's winning?
You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you.
He's allergic to everything.
Shut your big fat mouth!
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
Are you going out somewhere?
A girl's always gotta look her best.
Hey Shelly, like seafood?
Uh huh, why?
Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
Well he just left, what's wrong?
I'm hemorrhaging.
It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.
I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
I will I promise.
At what?
No.
Where's your bike?
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
No, I don't wanna.
Hmmmm, interesting.
I told you i'll get in trouble.
I am not.
They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.
Can we go yet?
Jump in the water!!
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
Well, let's spit on it.
What?
Is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public?
Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?
And you believe that.
I wish.
Ben Gay.
I've missed a step.
Who?  The jerk who's running your life?
Maybe.  I should call Ben.
Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...
Well, somet...
Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...
Waiter! Check, please!
You're not eating.
Wow and wow.  You have a date, after this?
You miss her, huh?
Dance card filled?
No accents today.
I'm up against a deadline.
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
... yeah, that.
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
I called Connie and she said not to worry, She'll fill in for you.
Well, I have to go thank her for filling in and it's nice to know the tune she sang.
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.
You get her those Vitamin E right away.
Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.
What do you really want?
Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
Well, how about the shopping center?
How much?
Okay.
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
Didn't you get?... How are you?
I didn't think it would. She's calling herself L.A. Joan this- week. Last week it was Dakota. Guess if you have to change your name a state's as good as anything.
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
Who's that?
Nash.
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
Have your children been deaf since birth?
Tom. You remember?
Hello.
I've got a gig tonight.
End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.
I have to go. He sighs.
Oh.
What?
Can you make a rehearsal in the morning...?  Courtland wants to...
An album.
Where are you going?
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
You know Bill is really mad at you.
Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
What?
You go to school together?
Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
You always live there?
Who?
You sure do it loud.
Is that good?
You serious?
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
Who isn't?
How come you never talk?
How is it?
Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.
She doesn't talk?
So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.
What I did for fun for starters.  Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun...  No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else.
No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
That's indescribable.
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
No. Not really.
Mickey, you're wasting time!
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
How 'bout Mallory?
I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
Don't call my men assholes.
You think so, Frankie?
Want to talk to you.
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?
Where was that?
Okay.
Hey, boy - I'm talkin' to you.
Okay.
And his age?
Any other family?
That's two bucks, Joe.
In Birmingham.
That's right.
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn't come back.
Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.
How about it?
Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
My kids want me to teach them.
Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.
What about your boy?
I keep thinking about him.
They won't.
Water pump's busted. I don't know if it's worth fixin', but I need that car.
I'm trying to help, Duff.
No point fixin' it!
What d'you mean?
When I get set, I'll send for you.
'Round town.
A whole lot, Frankie.
Like what?
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
I said, I come to town with a girl.
No.
Better get him to a hospital.
How you doin', boy?
What did you say, boy?!
Come on, Pop.
Guess it's never been easy.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
I know just how you feel, son. But believe me, you're going about it the wrong way.
It ain't in me.
Why don't you guys buy your own?
Man, you won't like that back seat.
Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
Hell, I didn't know you was married.
Let's stay here, Will.
Is she good in the hay? No point marryin' her just to find out. Is there, baby?
He's your son.
Let's go.
You hate Raoul?
Omar, your wife's here.  Ny superiors: will allow me to make the trade now.  But I gotta see that you haven't hurt the other hostages.  If you haven't, I'11 take the girl and send in your wife.
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
Can you get us into Straylight?
A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
An odd selection, Mr Case.
I saw your girl yesterday.
Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.
Jah guides us.
Right...
Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
Why would you want me to kill you?
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
What about before that?
You've been calling her name.
On a good run... yeah.
Too late?
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
Yeah... fine.
Case... Are you alright?
I'll be okay.
I know.
When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
Well, do you?
Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
– uhh, must have forgotten-
Right. 7:30.
It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
Oh, man! Who told?
Well excuse me.
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller".
A flack jacket.
Uhh, no.
Hey there.
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
You like her?
Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.
Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.
That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
Yes.
What?
We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
By name.
That's not true.  It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...
Taste it.
No.
Why not?
<i>                      This is a thing called a present. The whole thing starts with a box...</i>
Where are you going?
How much longer you figure he'll keep us out here?
Oh Jesus.  I'm gonna be sick.
You're wasting your time, the guy's a basket case.
Are you nuts or something?
The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.
I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
Okay, schmuck.  What do you want me to do?
Hi!  You didn't have to wait.
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
I think it's sad...
Who?
Sorry.  Schneider id it to me again.
Here.
C'mon, cut it out.
About not finding any bogey men?
I'm not hungry.
I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.
I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to stay awake - I'm ruining your party. They're gonna put me away for sure.
Fred Krueger.  He's been trying to get hold of me, to use me.  He needs me to get out of his world into ours...He's gonna take me again.
'Morning.
Oh...uh, no, just some milk, Mom.
Hi Mom.
Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
I thought I'd wait for you.
I gotta stay up, Max.
Jennifer --
Kincaid -- we should find the others first...
I don't know.  I'm busy with school. New friends.  But I'll never forget the old ones.
Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
You did it the other night.
Joey needs us.  I can feel him.
What's that?
What are these, beauty marks?
Max, where's Kristen?
Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
Tell me about the kids.
You're late.
Never been here before?
Must have opened while I was away at school.
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
That's what I know.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
Doesn't matter.
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
Oh Christ.  Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night.  They sedated her.
I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit.
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
That's precisely what they need.  Some uninterrupted REM sleep to release all this negative energy.
We've got work to do.
That's enough, Kincaid.
In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves, demon begone.
Well, they can be.
Fifteen million dollars.
Really?
No thanks.
I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
Nothing.
She saw through me.
You've got to go.
This is the place.
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
Eleven.
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
Wow.
It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
Stay forever.
Undressed like this, yes.
Excuse me?
This is certainly... ah...
Hi.
Well... how have you been?
But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
Does the girl have a name?
He wouldn't say.
Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly what are you doing here with Anna Scott?
Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Still loves you though.
Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.
This painting isn't the original, is it?
Di Caprio.
Well, thanks, that's great.
Ahm... room service.
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
Any more announcements?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
Which was?
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
No -- you're right.
What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan.
Fabulous.
Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
N-n-n-n-duh-duh-duh-pl-pl-pl-pl-muh muh-muh...
Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
Yes, Mister McMurphy.
H-H-Hearts.
Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody.
She won't give me any more cigarettes!
That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
I second the motion!
Yeah, Mack?
Where's Martini and Scanlon?
He's a big flounder. Could weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift him in with a winch.
I'll bet a dollar.
Did to me?
Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.
Lobotomy!
You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!
I refuse!
Yesterday...
I saw thum! I saw thum!
My, my... Ah, who are you?
Poker!
Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' What do you say to that?
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
When?
What's troubling ya, buddy?
How do ya know that?
Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
You just come on with that three fifty and Martini will take care of himself... Your dice, Scanlon.
Hey, how ya doin', cutie?
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
He's a patient, Rose...
Hi.
Yeah!
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.
I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle!
I thought so.
He's dead.
I-- I must've misplaced it.
Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
What for?
No.
No.
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
...has a prior commitment.
But, Faith--
Hello?  Is anybody there?
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
NO.
Does he love you?
You didn't answer my question.
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
Oh.  That's nice.
And she's a knock-out, too.
What?
Well, what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway.
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
Yes.  I am.
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
What would you call it?
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
Been here long?
I'll look forward to it.
Sure.
Well, to-- new friends.
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
Oh, hello.
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
I don't have an Amana freezer.
What's he do?
But what?
You don't have a passport.
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
What are you doing?
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
So?
Your brother?
I told you a liter was less than a gallon.
That was a long time ago.
Faith--
Yeah.  Sociopaths.  They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
Hi-iii...
So, you've had a little bad luck.
Peter found him?
No one's perfect, Kate.
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
Yup.
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
Huh?
This is the last one before the wedding, right?
Sociologist.  And because.  Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?
She what?!
I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?
He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him.
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
It isn't brains. It's how you use them.
The moment I saw you.
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
Now you got me! It's a wonder I wasn't punchy by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me with!  They thought they could beat an education into me—I foxed 'em.
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
Do you like pigeons?
What for?
He had a few birds.  I got up and fed 'em this morning.
Wham... .
How do you like it?
Were you really a prize fighter?
I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But— I didn't stay in shape— and—  —I had to take a few dives.
Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts!  You really believe that drool?
You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.
I can't let myself fall in love with you.
Terry— what's happening to you?
Don't tell me— don't tell me!
You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
Get out of my way.
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
A question of who rides who.
How much is your soul worth if you don't?
I want to see you, Terry.
You go to hell.
Down to the wire?
You looking for me?
Some chance at ten percent a week! And if he don't borrow, he don't work.
Boy, you must've been up early.
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
No advice. Just whiskey.
I'll bring him up to your loft.
Forty-five bills.
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
My favorite little cousin.
I know, Johnny, I know... .
Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan...  Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker?
Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
You see, Kayo, the good Lord watches over us after all.
I was afraid one bottle might get lonely by itself.  Now you see the advantage of a little man in a big coat.
Definitely! Nolan, my boy, you're a walkin' distillery.
What are you down here for— to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
Where?
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
Not dead?  In a cemetery?
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
A situation easily remedied.
The moon is almost gone!
Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
I understand, Master
You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
The time...is short.
Yes, Master.
Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
You know better than that.
Ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin!  May it ever be so adventurous!
I don't like snakes.  I remember the one Cleopatra used.  Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs.  You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.
Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Aannnnaahhnn.
Aannnnaahhnn.
Lie face down on the floor.
Yes.
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?
He'd call every once in a while.
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
Did you know that when you married him?
Where in the hell are we?
I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.
You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up?  You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?
What?!
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?
Whatta you think?
I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you?
Forty-five minutes.
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
Yes, she did.
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
You know they gonna set us up.
I get that feeling, yeah.
Half for doing what?
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
Come <i>on</i>.
We made it, didn't we?
Jack --
Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
How are you, Raymond?
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.
Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.
I bet.  How much?
Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor.
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
How many was that?
Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
Who was it answered the phone?
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
And your gun.
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
What, as a sales rep?
I like your hair.  And that suit.
I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
It's not a game.  Something you play.
Well, does it make sense to you?
It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
You getting serious on me now?
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
You think he's lying?
I see better with them on.
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
I don't know.  I never used a gun.
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down now.  Haven't we, Jack?
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
Jesus, I don't believe it.
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
Why's that?
Gee, I wonder why not.
I'm freezing my ass off.
Me?
Can I do what?
I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is <i>my</i> job.  You're either in or you're not.  You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine.
I think you're forgetting, this is my car.  I drove it up here.
I can tell.
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
You not with probation, one of those?
No.
Was a she, name Tuffy.
Thanks, Dad.
Oh, he's moved out?
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
You used to like it.
Hello?  Yeah, she is.  Just a minute.  For you.
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
Midge.
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.
You're Walker, right?
You liked that?
Rafe's girl, Evelyn?
Good shooting, Rafe!
Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
Nah, you go on.
Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like you're thinking.
Get me into a plane!
What's there?
You hear my okay?
It's not getting any longer.
We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China.  I'm on your wing.
Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
No baseball diamonds, Red.
There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away.
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
Hello, Lilla!
That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
What happened?
What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!
Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
Why wait?
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
Is this slow enough for you?
But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
What are you doing here?
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
How'd you know about that?
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
Does this mean you like me again?
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
What?
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
Yes, sir.
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
Are you for real?
Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons.
But I'm remembering the future.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
What're you doing here anyway?
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.
Thank God for that.
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
How did it go with the pantyhose?
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
I'm excused.
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
For what?
And the butter.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
What was?
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
I	know what a burrito is.
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
You look pretty good for a corpse.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
What will they be made of?
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.
Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
So are you. You've got a vision.
I was building a doggy door.
You took over for Doctor Yolander?
Out?
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...
I think so.
Damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him. I swear that dog's an idiot.
What's his name?
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
Is this a good spot?
Come on, that's just a bullshit story. You said so yourself...
How can he not have a heartbeat?
Are we interrupting, Andy?
That's the third time. I better call the office.  Would you relax, please?
Thanks for leaving school, and coming here, and...  I will be back. An hour, tops.
You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane?
Take it easy, Walter.
Client of yours?
Whoa-oh!  Sorry, I...
Continue.
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face?
They didn't fire her?
One more thing, Your Honor...
Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive...
Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
I've considered that.
Can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror?
Excellent work, Joe. I thank you.
Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth anniversary?
Why are we going to do that?
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
Not when I was in the Navy.
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation.
It's good to be King, hey Charles?
Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into our men's room. He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic.
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
Oh, Lord....
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
You sure you can keep --
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
There....
Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.
What, switch what?
S'matter?
Didn't bite.
Sorry. Thought I heard something.
Like what?
I <u>know</u> what happened -- he went off on the guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he's trying to --
I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
Where's Mr. Johns?
And pointless.
A toast to whatever he just said.
What the hell are these?
She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
Say that again.
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
An' this?
What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?
Take it.
No.
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
Taylor -- quit riding him.
But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
Hmph.
There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
Good morning, Dr. Zira.
If only we could get a fix.
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
Who are you?
So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
I want her.
Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
What is it?
I think you're making a mistake.
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
Then there is another jungle?
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
It's him...Landon.
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
Listen-
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
Maybe not.
What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?
It's humiliating.
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
Says he can't walk.
C'mon man, didn't I do you right that time I give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.
Shit, I bet I been laid more'n you have.
Yeah?
Come on you can do better than that!
I got one...
Come on man!
...I can't sleep, why don't you get some sack time.
Alright, Six says torch this place! Blow the weapons in place. Round up all suspected Vee Cees and shake it up! We ain't got much light left.
Merle?
I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.
You wanted to see me sir?
You don't want to hear about it?
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
I'm supposing.
How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.
What's the matter?
The brush-off, huh?
Don't I even get my face slapped?
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.
How careful should I be?
Good evening, Miss.
How long would that take?
Immigration Officer?
Good morning. Can I do something for you?
What did you say his name was?
Would it make you anymore amusing?
Do you think I don't?
Bad enough.
So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
Just who are you, anyway?
You, too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
Want to dance?
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
Absolutely sure.
Us?
That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.
Cant be too close for me.  Right across the street from it suits me.  Anything else listed?
They're going to arrest me.
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
Killaine...
You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
That, and the fun of it.
Including Killaine.
It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.
Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
You've had dealings with the police before?
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
Jeff.  Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?
They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff.
He could have killed me a dozen times.  You'd never have known.
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night
What'll you have, Margo?
All right, let's see the buzzer.
That must hurt.
That COULD BE TOLD.
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys.
And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
You nasty, sardonic--
I'm a very observant man. You had something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw him again.
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
She didn't seem the type to lam out--even if she got the chance. That stuff was all gone through last night.  Anything special you're looking for, Inspector?
"G.G. Market one-eight-four-two."
I think so.
Where's the shell?
Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do?
Do I know who lives down there?
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
I'm interested in who handled it.
She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.
I hear she's a very pretty girl.
Ye have, have ye?
We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
You're a young man.  You're romantic.  You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart.  You'll grow out of that.
I have a rough idea.
Years, why?
Thank you.
I will, thanks.
Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now — the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act.  A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it.  The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all.
No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
Congratulations.  Who with?
I know, I know!  Gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to The Cold War.  James Penfield.  He wrote the opening chapter, on 'The Berlin Airlift'.  One of the best chapters in the book.
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.
No.  I'd want to--
It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez.
So it's all worked out perfectly...
I thought it was tremendous.
Too bad.  What did your father do?
Oh yes?
Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious.  I really was upset. I stopped going home.  I never phoned.  I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand.  So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart.  And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
Very thoughtful.
Again?
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
Did she talk about me?
I haven't really thought about it.
One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA.
You approve!
Oh yes.
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
I'm not here.
I won't.  Goodnight.
Don't you want to walk, Tom?
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave.
One shot stopping.
You're a fucking dead man--
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
Sir?
1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
Oh well he must be a surfer.
Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
Johnny, it's the only way.
Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?
They're on their way to Maui.
Angelo!  Don't fire!
Kid, get outta the way!!
What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
This gonna take long?
Catch of the day.
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
You had enough?
Those are cold.
Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
Major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper.  Then a different set of track, over there.
Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals.
Who's our back-up on this?
Mean anything to you?
What story did you give to Davis?
We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
This isn't your style, Dillon.
That's over the border, General.
There's something else, Major...
What in God's name...?
No.  What I have is a lot of money.
I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
No, you look like a hooker.
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
You're not from L.A., huh?
What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian.
Three hundred.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
Get in.  This side.
What?
Right.  So!  In town on business?
It's a very good year.
Mmm, I could tell.
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
I sell them.
By breaking up a company's assets --
Any good?
You're upset, huh?
I have work to do.
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
You won't.
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
Where are you taking me!?
Huh?
Vivian, I've thought about this a lot.  This is the best solution.
Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.
Right.
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight?
You're being ridiculous.
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  You there?
I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
Looks slow tonight.
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
You sure you won't come with me?
Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
Niece?
But what if they serve soup?
Hi, Barney!
Excuse me?
Get out!
Till they kill you. Yeah.
My Westley will always come for me.
Every ship but the four you sent.
Brides often are, I'm told.
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
You mock my pain!
Well ... you were dead.
Singed a bit, were you?
I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
Why is that, do you think?
It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
I only dog paddle.
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book?
What? What?
Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
You don't know any way you'll trust me?
Because I know something you don't know.
There's something I ought to tell you.
No one of consequence.
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
I want to duel him left-handed.
Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
I accept.
You've made your decision then7
You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck
A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
An hour.
I'll wait in the hall ...
I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention.  Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people?
Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
Here, don't panic.
They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
Assume away!
Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
Exactly.  And how long did it run?
Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
You bet your boots, Leo.  It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise. Upward and onward.  Say, you'll join me.  Nothing can stop us.
Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is.
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
Do you think he'll take the job?
So much for Nutsy Fagin.
Yes.
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...
But he has long hair!
Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't let you down.
Do it!  Do it!
Good.  Good.  We go Motel.
Is it all right?  I made it out to cash.  You didn't tell me the name of the play.
I solemnly swear...
Nietzche...
Heil you know who!
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.
Oh, sing.  Sing!
Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?
Or arrived with her.
She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
She isn't still here, is she?
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
Sick of the sight of it!  Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about...
Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...
Of course not. Please.
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
Did he say anything about my sister?
May I talk to you?
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
She'll need both of us.
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
Our Deputy sleeps.
Of course we will.
We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
What makes you sound so certain?
You can't go up there.
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
I can come down next week.
I'm thinking of it.
How can you even think a thing like that!
You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
I'm sorry. I wish... people could apologize for other people.
You eat like a bird.
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
Only my share.
Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...
Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
You slept here all night?
Is there?
Oh?
Barefaced.
Satisfied with your cabin?
That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper...  ...by candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you saw an old woman?
No mother.
Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.
Imagine--she was alive. What a horror. Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the morgue.
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.
Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.
Thousands?
Oh, <U>I'm</U> crazy, am I? Let me tell you something.  Those women have--the gleam--
What is it now?
You killed him!  Come on with the rest of it. You killed him!
What are you laughing at?
I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.
Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
It happens that I'm the law.
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
As I live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince.
Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.
Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
Just this -- I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up, then I'm crazy.
No kiddin'?
Almost certain.
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
What does that prove?
Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.
What are you people doing out in the middle of the night?
I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
That happens to be the truth.
Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
But the composition as a whole -- I've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
To lunch.
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
Shall we unpack it?
You did miss --
Mia...?
Could we go somewhere?
Nothing is real until it's perceived.
No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.
I've been dreaming about this.
She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
I know, Mother.
They were just bad men, that's all.
I didn't hear you. I didn't hear that.
But, Rose, what is the cause of it all?
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
But Rose...
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
Yeah, I'd believe it.
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
Five hundred rabbits?
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
How did the rabbits kill him?
Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
Well, a little.
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast?
What do you think, Brother?
See that, son? Now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. Someone has been walking here.
See, son? The paint is flaked off here, freshly. Look at it, Brother, there is no question about it. Some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder.
In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel.
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
Is that all?
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
What's all this about Rose? What do you mean, you heard from her in a manner of speaking?
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
How goes it, darlin'?
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
No reason at all, darlin'.
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
Who is to say our morals are better than hers?  But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...
How could Rose really be a bad influence on Dolly? She has a loving nature, you ought to want someone like that around your children. Why do you think those boys and men like her?
They follow her because she's a --  -- no, I won't say that.
Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a rascal, he's one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University.
She hasn't actually done anything...
Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!
You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?
That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No forwarding address, huh?  In the shock of this brilliant move, I forgot something.
I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
Who?
Well, thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time!
All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
Oh, I don't know, I... I...
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.
Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the hotel. You and Brother can handle the girl's epizootics. I'll just say one more thing.  Rose, I told you you had a friend in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she would fight for you like a tiger?
I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?
Well, we know you were there. The bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
Oh, yeah?
Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.
I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.
Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
Yes, thank you, Doctor.
I'm not surprised you thought she was pregnant. An ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy. But it was pure wishful thinking on her part. The girl can never have children, she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated.
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
Well, you run on now.
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
No more dentists, no more dentists...
You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
What... ?
She's right.  If you two are doing the horizontal polka, the last thing you want is a thirty-five pound bundle-of-joy stumbling around, knocking over furniture and calling you "daddy."
Make a hole, Billy-Boy.
Relax.
We should slow down.
Wh... what... ?!
I don't know what the problem is. Plenty of great men throughout history got their bravery out of a bottle
Gimmie a butt.
Birth control's important.
I'm back here, aren't I?  So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
"Leo.  The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.  Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
Smooth move, hot-shot.
Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.
General Jim Beam, then.
You could start over again with cash like that.
Well, sir...
Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
Couldn't have said it better myself.
It's our job.
Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.
Oh yeah?
He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
We're screwed.
The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
Yoda spoke of another.
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
I have felt him, my Master.
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
What's he saying?
Quiet.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
Well, I'm sorry.
How many languages do you speak?
I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
Uh huh.
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
Right!
No, don't do that.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
Like I'm outside in the rain
Wheeling
Oh, no no, no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
...I don't know.
...Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.
Why?
I think he might be worried.
It's all right -- You're my guest.
...What?
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
...What?
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
I can't go out.
Do me a favor -- His lungs, punch 'em out.
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
Owe you what?
What?!
You're hurtin', man!
One more round.
...Stop jivin'!
Damn.
...It's very American.
Fouls.
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
No wine.
...Ten minutes.
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
Apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations. Balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on Creed's temple -- not much movement from Balboa, duck a left, a right, another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- I mean explodes. The Champ backs off.
You can forget about sparring, kid.
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
That's it.
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
Ya sure?
Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
You think I don't hear things?
Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
...Thanks.
No -- Just me.
What'd you say?
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?
Makes your breath like garbage.
More like thirty.
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it.
Ya puttin' me on?
I seen the light. I figure somebody was home.
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
Freak luck for sure.
Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture.
Wanna keep goin'?
How I look out there, Mick?
No more, ya wanna lose an eye? No more.
My sister's a friggin' loser.
What kinda business?
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
It don't matter.
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
How ya feelin'?
Y'know, d'ya think you an' my sister -- Ah, doin' good together?
What gaps?
Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
What was <u>that</u>?
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
What's that comin' from the bar?
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
Surprised?
Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
Toon cops worked me over.
No...
So altruistic.
It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
You shot Roger.
Doom.
I don't work in Toontown.
Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
Yeah?
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
Keep reading...
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
I do bite my thumb, sir!
Then I'll leave thee.
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
Romeo will answer it?
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
What dares the slave Come hither, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law is death to any that utters them.
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Hold Daughter!
Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
Juliet!
[Within] Juliet!
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
I dream'd a dream to-night.
And so did I.
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
Is she a Capulet?
If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.
Do you really think so?
Not to me, you know that.
You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
Check this out.  Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...
Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
Really?  Do you have the money with you?
Do you have it?
What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.
Whoever hired us.
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
What are you doing?
Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for now.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
Created?
Eat shit and die slowly...
I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.
As in, they own it?
I didn't know that you spoke French.
Jujitsu.
It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
Like Larry or Swede.
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
So is the woman.
I wanted to see who you were.
I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
You don't have to do this.
Clearly.
The Irish representative?
Dark ops?
I never made that claim.
Give me a cigarette.
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
What?
"Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you.
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
I'm alright.  And you?
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.
Can you get it?
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
I'd like to know what they were doing in my town!  Did you get ID off any of them?
Don't spend it all in one place.
Thanks for the loan, man.  I'll have it in a few days, I promise.
Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
There must be over a million dollars in here.
What do you mean what are we going to do?
It won't work.
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
We'll torch the bases, how's that?
I've got one condition.
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
I...I can't do that.
I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that!  We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one.
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
Not bad enough to kill him.
We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
No.  Why?
Well, we have one lead and that's what I'm looking into next.
What's that?
Yeah?  So?
What for?
There's an ATM on Speedwell Avenue.
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
Yeah I'm fine.
OK.  I love you.
He's not, he's...
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?
Business is business.  Now where the hell is it?  I wanna get out of here.  That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying?
He kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening.  I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Don't you have to be here?
Dwayne.
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
Yeah.
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.
Anything...specific?
I don't suppose you've seen her.
Have I seen her?
No, I can't say that I have.
Aw, now that’s gonna take time to clear!
I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's up?
Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?
I can't hear a word you're saying!
Whatever...
I'll settle for a third of that.
At least around here it does.
Well what do you know!  An air conditioner.
This whole place?
Don't you want it?
There was more than that.
I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.
Is this about the funny money?
How'd you know?
Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
I'm busy at the moment.
Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?
I'm sorry.
Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
You.
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
You pull a muscle or something?
Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
I don't understand?
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
I'm not used to having a partner.
Well we're not friends.
No mu-shu.
Who's Benjamin?
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
Red Dragon.
Let's go.
No you didn't!
We made it, man.
Yes.
What is this?
They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.
I could use a little vacation.
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
Any leads?
Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --
He was the best I ever trained, you know.
Chin, you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the FBI and Secret Service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need.  If you have information, it belongs to us.
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
What plate?
Let's go.  Everybody take off?
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
That's not how it goes.
Yes, I think so.
What are you doing here?
No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
You're killin' me here.
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
No...what?
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
How about a lift home?
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
Hello.
I would like one of my people to help.
He is very good.
I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got Œem.
At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you.
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
Lesson number two.  Never work for your former spouse.
... Just call me when you have it.  Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater?
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
Then you'll be my best man.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
Everest.  Is that right?
Twice...
You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
I'm a work in progress.
You don't know.
Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.
Tell me.  When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
Of what?
Where did you disappear to?
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
And the church.
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
I'm going to kill myself.
Lighten up, wahine.
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
Let's go.
Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
You tell Maggie.
No, you tell her.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
There's no why, Annie.  I'm just not up for it.  I never said I was.
How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
I hate boats.
Even when you were young?
I was thinking, I have to go up to Boston for the AAP convention and then visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers.  Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend?
Walter, I'd love to --
Miss Scarlett.  In the broom closet.  With the radio.
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
I know that.  You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 
Can too.
And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
Men never get this movie.
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
You don't know who she was, Annie --
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
Are you Annie?
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
What?
Mom!
Hello.
Which means --
Great.  This is great.  The whole town knows.  Just out of curiosity, how do you two know?
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
Why not?
What are you going to do, Sam?
I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda ... She's a weightlifter, but it's not like her neck is bigger than her head or anything --
How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
So I can go.
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
She looks like my third grade teacher.  I hated my third grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait a minute! She <u>is</u> my third grade teacher!
It doesn't.  They ask you.
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
Jonah!
God, she's beautiful.
Is he there?
I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?
Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse?  Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
Why are they singing, Mama?
We're only one payment behind. I argued with her. It isn't right.
What?
First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
Yes.
A meeting?
I waited up till midnight.
Where are you going?
Hunting.
You know I don't think that.
Well, if that's possible ...
It's possible. Just negotiate.
Forgot what?
Boy! Did you see the way Mama whopped that deputy with her shoe? Knocked the gun right out ...
What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway.
Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.
Who wouldn't?
Then make sure he gets put away for longer.
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
What do you want from me, Colette?
What's wrong, Danny?
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
Why?
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
Twelve
Nice day
Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
What?
Wait  If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?
Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth.
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
Come on, guys ...
Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.
When?
I was trying to score some dope.
I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
Whatever you say, man.  Look ... can we talk about this?
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
He knows somebody ratted him.
What's on the other end of this thing?
That would be me.
Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys?
You, madam, are a heartless wench.
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
You think that's a good idea?
Here it comes, poor Tom.
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Report.
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
Where are your men now?
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
Jackson?
Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.
You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
So, that's Ryan.
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.
I'd love to hear it.
Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.
A half-track, anything.
On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him.
But you could have gotten killed and I...
It looks like a Renoir.
It seemed appropriate.
I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.
Goddamn it, sir...
Worked, didn't it?
You get a translator, Captain?
PUSH!
Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?
Since when have things been normal?
Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
Is it getting worse?
Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?
I don't think so, Captain.
Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles.  He sees his men and walks toward them.  Reiben hurries up to Miller, pleading.
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
Ours is not to reason why.
In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance.
Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
You set?  Sarge nods.
Hell, I don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at Ramelle for...
We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
What's the profile?
Good for her.
Hey, sis.
I hope you understand.
Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.
Lloyd, give it up.
See you tomorrow.
Alright, alright, alright, calm down, alright, calm down. Nothing's different.
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
I wouldn't get my hopes up Lloyd.
Look at his face, he did the deed.
What?  I'm sorry, talk.
Hey, I know this is a strange thing to say, but maybe Diane Court really likes Lloyd.
What are you doing?
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
I'm sorry.
I just had a phone call.
Lloyd?
You're going.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
Bon voyage.
Dad, are you okay in there?
But I found the money.
What am I supposed to think?
I made their lives better.
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
Hello.
Thank-you.  The real world.
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Nice one.
I know you think my job is strange.  You don't like old people, do you?
Okay, bye, I will.
Okay.
I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
Yeah.
You're cold.
I don't think I am.
Why didn't you tell me?
Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
No, I don't, I don't.
Did you talk to Corey?
She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
I love you.
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
Okay.
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
YEAH!
No.
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
Fine Lloyd.
Thanks Lloyd.
How do you pay for one of those?
Are you?
I know.
I know
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
Certainly.
Later for you, Luke.
What?
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
You asked for shoe polish.
This is not my problem.
Of course I'm on it.
Yeah.
One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  I'd like the chance to defend myself.  I'd like my wife to have that chance.  My civilian engineers. My secretary.
We're losing the war, aren't we.
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
I don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.
You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.
Eight hundred, give or take.
Well, that's to be expected.  They have to understand.  These are start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business.  I'll write them a letter.
They're withholding payment.
I'll talk to you later.
We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.
Shit.
I heard a noise.
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
I did that.
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.
What's your subject?
I think he's doing Dolly.
Yeah.
This is exactly what I don't want.
I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
He seemed harmless.
We’re hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
Or it found us.
I see you read the book.
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
Jesus Christ!
Dewey?
They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
Oh--a God complex
You're getting obvious.
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
I don’t know.
I have rehearsal.
He tried to kill her first.
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
Have they questioned you yet, Sid?
What do you care? Let 'em have their fun. So, what's up?
But...
I get scared really easy, okay.
I'll be right back.
What do you want?
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
Melinda McGraw?
Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.
Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
Jesus Gale what happened?
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.
Hmm.
What does this have to do with Sid?
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
Gale, your engine's still running.
Do you have her number stored in your memory?  Phone memory!
But you know who she was.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
Your life?
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
Who's phone?
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
Huh, fine.
But you know my favorite name?
W-what do you want?
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
Alright, I'm here. Now what?
What? She asked.
I didn't kill anybody.
Dude. What are you doing here?
And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.
No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
Billy? What the...
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
Or even a good porno.
I called my dad.
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
Uh-huh.
I thought you were...
I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.
Popcorn.
Really? What?
Just some scary movie.
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
Why do you want to know my name?
That all depends on you.
No...
No it's not. It was Jason.
...leave me alone... please...
What door am I at?
Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.
Sidney's father?
Does mom know?
Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
What? What?
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
Why would she lie about it?
You're evil.
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
So what's his reason?
Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...
Which is you...
Do you believe this shit?
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
Take a message.
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on.
You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school.
Thank you.
You don't.  It goes to court now.
He's pissing in our faces again and we're just taking it.
So what?  This victim...
No, I haven't heard.
Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
And... and... and he said... he asked me if I was married.  And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.
I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
Where we headed?
I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.
I can't wait for you to see.  I can't wait...  It's really going to be something.
Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
Innocent?  Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed.  An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you.  Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish  your meal.  After him I picked the lawyer.  And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one.  This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets.
Delusions of grandeur.
I'm a little thrown.  I just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here.
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.
It's a bucket of vomit.
You think it was poison?
How's that?
What about sports?
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
You're sure your men didn't move this?
Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?
Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
Oh, that's all.
It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
We're focusing.
The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
Are you alright?
By the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead.
No dates indicated, placed on the shelves in no discernible order.  It's just his mind poured out on paper.  I don't think it's going to give us any specifics.
You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?
You do your job...
Where's the victory?
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.
Oh, you want to stay now?
I need you to look at each one carefully... very carefully.  Look for anything that seems strange or out of place.  Anything at all.
I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.
How's California?
It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.
You all right, sergeant?
They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.
I didn't give any order to fire!
Evenin'...evenin' Reverend...or do I call you 'Captain'...?
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?
Well, the reward still stands...
Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
Say it. We're beat!
That don't make 'em kin...
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
Why didn't he make his move back there?
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
Not far from it...
I'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am.
You've seen her!...She's alive?
Might at least have left me my pants!
Finish your breakfast...
Martie...don't go! Not this time.
You crazy?
<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!
But couldn't you...?
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
So, did you sleep good?
Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
Where have you been?
Stop scaring people.  Let's go. We need to be on our way.
Oh…what have I done?
Lady?
My Massacre at Paris is complete.
The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
Words, words, words…once, I had the gift…I could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstones…for sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnery…but now
How long has it been?
When?
Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
And his ears.
by order of the Master of the Revels!
Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!
Will! Where is my play? Tell me you have it nearly done! Tell me you have it started.  You have begun?
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
I did not.
Nobody. The author.
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
How will it?
Another little problem.
Kit
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
And yours?
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.  Yes, I know.
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
The daughter of his enemy.
It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
As a nurse.
Verona again.
As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
Even your play.
That's my line!
Oh, but it will end well for love?
Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.
"…thou need'st not to be gone."
Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .
It is not my riding day, my lord.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
Take off your hat.
My hat?
No, sir.
If you love her, you must do what she asks.
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
Are you bringing your laundry woman?
A man, my lord?
In the same fashion as chess.
I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win.
I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time.
No.
No.
But not quite.
I don't know.
Looking for you? Yes.
Your friends.
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
Where do you think you'll go?
Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.
It looks like he's writing everything down.
Just one thing.
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
What?
Did you know --
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
Alex.
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
-- which is --
You're right.
David hasn't seen him either.
So I gathered.
So?
Did what?
What are you doing?
Don't.
I don't want to. It's different.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
We could put it somewhere.
You're frightened.
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
I see.
did you hear anything before he cries?
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
No, nothing, sorry.
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
What?
What do we do here, David?
Sorry?
Here.
Eh --
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
What guy?
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
The telephone? It continues to ring.
The human condition.
Take all the time you like, doctor.
No. I haven't seen them.
Yes.
Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
Who?
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
That you were just indulging me.
We cannot go into this later.
Why not?
-- What?
All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
Yes.
Is she all right?
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
You know what I'm talking about.
Well, is she your girlfriend?
It isn't?
You here to see my mother?
Did you hear me?
Why do you wanna know so bad?
Wonderful woman.
What sort of references do you have?
Pardon me?
Yeah.
Yes, Buffums.
You promised you'd do the show.
You're late, George.
You do it.
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
So how's Norman?
Jesus...
Look, either come in or stay out!
-- this guy with Jill.
We're upstairs, George. Now come on. Behave yourself, and for Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't let me drink too much.
-- you are.
No you didn't.
-- very nice, very nice.
-- but you never were much of a tit man --
Mmmm --
Why?
-- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
Don't go, Jackie...
I can't just let him stand by the door...
What for?
No, man.
-- Right after I sprayed her?
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
I've had these dumb dreams lately.
What?
George --
Keep moving --
How?
Yeah.
Will we live together?
You've never even been around one.
When can I talk to you?
Going where?
Your advice!
When?
I've got to get her out of here.
-- go ahead.
-- and take this with you.
Yeah, I know. Did you?
Did you?
No.
Said what!
Thank you.
It's good you want to do something, George.
Oh yeah? I mean I know.
What about, tonight?
I know it, I know it.
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
-- yeah?
Layered?
I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!
Was it me, did you have something against me?
Who?
Awww --
I'm coming over.
What do you mean?
I was too old.
You do?
My secretary saw you with that boy.
Steve?
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
Hi, Leonard.
Five times a day?
What?
Well, there was this one time --
Didn't you have any panties on?
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
Johnny!
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.
Have they sat down?
Why don't you want to talk about it?
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
Yeah.
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Red Rum.
if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
No.
Why not?
Where does he go?
And, er... where are they now?
Who?
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred.  Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie?
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
It's good to see you.
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
Perfect for a child.
What time is it?
Eleven thirty - Jesus!
Of course I am.
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
Wendy!
Stay away...!
Stay away from me!  Please...
Wendy...
I'm Jack Torrance.
JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
Not for me.
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.
I'm intrigued.
Well, obviously some people can be
Hi.
What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
Yes. Go away.
You booger.
Mom-!
What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
Well... was it a prescription?
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
There! You see!
What if I say no?
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
SING!
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
What?
What did who say?
Oh, girls.
Oh my! 
D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.
Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
All right, I am, I know it!  All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic.  Perky.  I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, "That child is pure sunshine.  She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess."
We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.
Is there any syrup?
Thanks.  So which one are you? Sister Bruce?  Sister Doug?
Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
Three years.  A rookie.
What?
We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert.
Who are all these people?
I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences.  I've learned so much.
Mary Clarence!
I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?
Sit down.
Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?
Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood?
Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's important, nowadays.  You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!
What?
Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
I must go where I can be of use.
Oh?
Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole.
Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
He didn't do you a favor.
And if I don't?
I hate you.  I totally hate you.
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
Me too.
What?
What're you doing?
Don't you have a concert to go to?
I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
Hail, Mary.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
He's so damn cocky.  This is different.
Well?
Joey?
She shouldn't have come back.  She knew she was in danger.
An... entertainer?
It's so beautiful...
I lied.
Who took the meat?
We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
I hit him square.
No bleeding.
He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.
It is sacrilege!
For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
Wallowing in sin and lust...
Damn... damn... damn...
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands.  It is named Sleepy Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off.  The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.
Master Crane, sir.  I'm glad we have time alone.  You've been told plenty about the Horseman, I'm certain.
Is that all you say?  Look at her.
The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next...
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.
Baltus Van Tassel.
Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
My suitor?
The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
It was not butchery.
I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.
It was you there?
And, what did he say?
What was that?
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
Can you help?
She is guilty.
They say you're a whiz on fixin' lawn mowers and things.
He's gone to stayin' over with that Wheatley boy and his mama in their garage. I think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot. But he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases. Everything's worked out good.
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
Okay ladies and gentlemen  or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy.  Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on! 
Leave.
Leave.
No sir.
I ain't sure.
Are you sure you can drive? You've really had a lot of alcohol.
On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins.  On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  On drums "The Johnson."  And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here.  Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl?
Don't hit that boy no more.
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
What's you last name?
What are all them books?
Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
How come?
Are you well?
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
They still around, your folks?
How do you know?
How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
Were they bad people?
Maybe they needed it.
Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.
Yeah, I recollect it.
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
Why not? It died?
Why?
Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl?
You will? For sure?
I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
Yeah.
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
You scared me.
Right now?
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
I don't think I've ever seen you before.
It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
They turned me loose from the state hospital.
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
Naw, I ain't.
Oh. How about before that?
I think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read constantly.
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.
I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.
You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go--
Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
Better make it charge. 
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
And what about for you?
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
What's the difference?
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
Hey, Auggie. How's it going?
Yeah, I did.
Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
I'd like to see your pictures some day.
You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?
He's crazy.
Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
Hey, man, how's it going?
Every word.
All right, sugar, what's on your mind?
That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.
You don't give up, do you?
You what?
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.
Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
Bully for you.
Why don't you open it and find out?
And you're giving it to me?
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
Seventeen.
A job?  I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.
It's for you.
Huh?
When I tell you it's open. It's open when I tell you it's open!
And how much are these?
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
And his parents?
I shouldn't have let him go.
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.
Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
That's where the what comes in.
Yeah, that's right.
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
Yeah, I can believe it.
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
Eight-thirty?
I don't have much time. 
Why don't you go to the police?
It looks like they've met in this apartment.
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
Yeah, I picked it up.
I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.
I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
And when he came home.  Did he write you about this?  Or phone, perhaps.
What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
A thousand.
Is that your third question?
Well, what if?
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
You're implying th...
So, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two.
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise.
Maybe it went.  Where Carl went. Over the side.
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
Your line of work.  You must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth.
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
But Carl was a fisherman.  And successful at it.
Sheriff said right off, I was under suspicion.  I didn't have a lawyer...
I have told the truth.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
Tell us why that lantern would be so significant.
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
Maybe...?
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
If I whistle.  Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'.  <u>You're</u> the story today.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.
I think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on.  Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
Does it now?
No.
I believe so.
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
Why?
Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.
You girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?
Cut it out, girls.  Stop it. Joe - Josephine - help!
Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks?
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?
The police?  We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo.  Wabash 1098.
And it's so drafty.  They must be catching colds all the time.
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
And I'm not even pretty.
They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
Me?  After Sugar?
You - you -
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
And where's he going to be?
Daphne - your boy friend is waving at you.
Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
Like what?
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
I feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses.
What are you giving me with the omelette?
Get me Room 414.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
She sings, too.
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
When I was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I used to crawl into bed with my sister.  We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.
No, no.
That's ridiculous.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
I'll carry the instruments.
Here you are, Sugar.
Oh, come on - you can do better than that.
I was it.
What's wrong with us?
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
I'm not surprised.
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
Goodbye?
But it's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -
Another bridesmaid?
I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
Don't I know you two from somewhere?
We won't breathe a word.
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
Me?
You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?
You are?
You're entitled.
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
Why not?
Your view of what?
How's the stock market?
- riding to hounds -
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?
Love it.  Which way?
Oh - in here.
What is it?
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
They just sort of leave me cold.
It's more like a mental block.  When I'm with girls, it does nothing to me.
Anything this time?
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
You're not giving yourself a chance. Don't fight it.  Relax. 
Good morning.
Oh, no.  I'm off that stuff - for good.
That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
Better bring the check now - in case the joint gets raided.
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
Big joke!
Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
You shave with your spats on?
Thanks, Charlie.
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
You don't owe me no nothing.
Are you sure you’re okay?
What for?
Huh?
I’m an American and in America, people sue. So to prevent a lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I don’t bake.
There’s a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldn’t split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
What?
No.
And Kat was fully clothed.
But, somehow, it was Kat’s arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
Oh, shut up. You’re an optician.
Nothing, nothing.
That was a long time ago.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. It’s no big deal. I promise.
Who are they?
Sorry. I’m a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.
Are you sure?
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
You didn’t have to do that.
You want I nut him in the boat?
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.
Uh huh...
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
And so you did your job, right?
:...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...
But, Charlie --
No buts, Rita!
If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.
When the fall comes in these parts, the Night moon runs away like a rabbit -- you could stay out here lookin' all night, and not see a thing out yonder.
Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
What happened afta that?
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
David!
Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!
What is it, David Lee?
I cut it on some glass and we got lost, Mama.
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
It's about the Three Musketeers.
I'll find out where your daddy is for you.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright! 
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
Come, I'll take you home.
If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
Well, let me have it.
Don't take all day at that table, David Lee.
Dammit, I'm talkin' to you, woman! I gotta farm to think about and I need answers.
The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!
Good mornin', Nathan.
If there ever was a devil in this county, Ike, you is it!
You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?
I see, all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field.
I just got out here!
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
What... are you?
Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!
Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
Montana.
Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?
But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
Is it Cartman's mom?
Oh, son of a bitch!  AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!
What?
Dude, this is seriously lame. I didn't know we were gonna get all dirty and stuff.
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
Dude, how can you hate the environment?
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
This is all cause of your mom, Kyle. She's such a bitch-  AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie.
Did you bring the pie and punch?
Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
Help yourself prickfuck!
What was that word, young man!?
Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?
Purpre mama!
MMMMMPHPHPHPHP!!!!!
Mph rmph rm rmph rmph rm!
Uhh... Bacon.
Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
Nowhere.
I'm so sick of these soldiers.
All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
I don't know. But it has gone far enough! I'm sick of it!  <b>Something must be done! Change has got to come around! They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of chains and ties and glue! We have to fight before they've taken every one! Something must be done!</b>
Dude, do you know what you're doing?
Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!
Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
We must take action on this immediately.
I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?
Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!
This is the millennium, Saddam! This is Armageddon! There's more to life than sex!
I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
Did you see that, Wendy?
Wendy?
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
Bedrock!  I cannot dig any further in zis direction!
You don't have watches?
Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!
Oh yeah...
My grandfather.  My God, I can't tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.
No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.
Where the hell did you come from?
And what are they doing now, Mac?
What did you say to me?
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
So, are you on for the next one?
Why, didn't they say?
You better start making sense!
That was a joke Taylor, lighten up!  Why don't you just hold them up to the lens.  I'll write them down, and once I'm through verifying them, I'll get back to you.
Look we gave you what you asked for.  It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!
It's time we lock coordinates.
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
Like that piece of ass he was with.
Damn it.  If only we could get to those suits... Dawn then thinks of something -
He certainly is polite.
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.
You're ready for the real thing?
What?  What are you talking about?
I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.
But how are you going to escape?
Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!
Is there anything I can help you with?
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
Homesick?  It's only been two days!
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.
You a mini-golfer?
You have orange whips?
Three whips. To go.
Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you...  What was that he said...?
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
You know, Elvis bowled.
gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
I got a right. You're my father.
Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.
I'm your blood.
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
It could just as easily have been me in that box.
You shouldn't touch her.
It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Junior's a problem child. He has a thing about -
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.
No!
What ever happened to just bowling?
A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
Uh...over easy.
No. Do You?
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
What? Be my body guard?  Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
Why not?
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
Can I come with you?
When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
You don't get two chances with Junior.
Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
Some unfinished business.
Who identified the body?
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
Back away then.
They told me about sixty hours.
Forty yards.
Thirty yards.
Increase positive pressure!
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
Then why am I here?
-- dating the crash at least that old.
It doesn't make any sense.
What team?
All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
What do you mean, he's missing?
I think I do.
'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
Damn it, Edmunds?
Can you open that panel?
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
Ted?  Captain?
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.
Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.
She wired this system.
Look at this.
Radiation shield, you think?
What's wrong?
We had considered it.
But what does it do?  This... sphere.
Sir, about leaving --
To what?
I love secrets.
Wait -- down where?
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
The timing has never seemed quite right.
What?  Why...
Beth --
... He lied to us.  He left us down here.
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
"Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft.  Signed, Barnes, USN."
What?
Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
The refridgerator.
Wait a second --
Page 87.
I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.
Ulcers.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Bingo.
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
Causes sleep.
How long does it last?
How fast does it take effect?
You want to kill him?
I'm sorry.
You know what I mean.
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
He can't manifest.
I never went in that sphere.
Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.
Don't, Beth.  Please.
Then where's it coming from?
I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
You sound defensive.
I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
What are you still doing here?
You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
Page 87 of what, Harry?
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
Push her, c'mon.
Missed.
Hold on.
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
How's that working out, by the way?
The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?
Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
Meaning?
Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
The others, sir?
Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
What report?
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how it would have a button.
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
I don't know.
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.
That is not a human decision, not your or mine.
What do you mean?
How can you store an energy field within you?
That's where my father was killed.
This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
What's wrong?  What's happening?
But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
Of course, where you been kid?
We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.
You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.
Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.
But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.
Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...
Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
How do you make him do that ?
Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
Please continue, Sergeant.
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.
Johnny, this is Zander.
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
WHERE IS IT ?
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
Where are you going ?
How do you feel about him now ?
35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.
You can't walk me home.
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
What happened to your hair ?
A lot can happen in three minutes.
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
Guess you gotta go.
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.
Oh, my, what's that ?
Looks like rain.
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
I won't quit !
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ?
I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job.
You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
What is your position ?
What's that look like to you, Rico ?
Disclose the information.
Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
You are what...?
Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
<U>Computer off</U>!
    , if we do not provide     V'ger with certain information, we won't have twenty-two <U>seconds</U>; the plan must be implemented upon arrival.
Hello, Ilia.
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
Hold station...!
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on.
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
Child...!?
Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
Captain, we need further Warp simulation on the flow sensors...
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
I quit.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Well.  Everybody has reversals.  If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
I...
You get what you pay for.
That: in an act of...
Of course.
Goodbye.
So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
...who...?
What I need to <u>say</u>...
Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  And <u>you</u> get a second chance!
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
What are you doing down there?
Fix my glasses.
"Room Service!"
Would you put on your cl...  Just leave it outside.
I'm gonna be your typist for this evening.
Thank you.
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
Because I'd met someone else.
You believe that?
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
...he stuck a fishhook in it. 
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
Not without a rolltop desk.
Carla was in the car, right?
What are you going to do?
We had a date.
Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
Well, I <u>know</u>, because they <u>told</u> me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what I mean, the whole <u>town</u> has been warped by the, by, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a <u>date</u>, they call, you're doing business nine o'clock at night.  It isn't...
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
No.  Don't tell me that.
Maude, this <u>man</u> wrote this <u>play</u>!
What?
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
Okay, look, you, what is she, 19, twenty...oh Christ...
What'll I do for fun?
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
She's a <u>waitress</u>.
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
I'm very sorry to...
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...
I wasn't in the car.
I just...
This is Joe White.
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
I know that...
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
...I know...I know...
Yes.
And you know what...?
We, we have to give it.
What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
I know...
Did she throw up?
That isn't very nice.
She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil?
Who got their heads cut?
Why?
...little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party...City Council...?  What's the trouble...?
Arrest him.
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
That, that's <u>your</u> life's blood on the st...
Not now.
I know you do.
Grace, get on the other phone, call that girl: well, call her, and have whatsername send up some <u>nosh</u>...what do you like to drink...?
I hurt my finger.
I've got a date.
You want me to lie.
I'm out.
And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
How are you getting on with these fine people?
I don't got the money.
Find the money.
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
There's no witnesses...
...we don't have thirteen at table...
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...
Don't you <u>touch</u> that...I want them gone.
Yes, I hear it.
She coulda done better than him.
You see where Tom Miller's playin' the Old Farmer?
So what's up?  Who's marrying who <u>this</u> time?
I don't want that to happen.  Why would I want that to happen?
Mass hysteria.
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself.
I said...
A debate.  Man's inhumanity to woman.  He's pro women.  I'm con. Ms. Flannery is twisted.
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.
Here.
Lunch time Sleeping Beauty.  Where's Ben?  Is he in the bathroom?
Annabelle, I know you miss your mother.  So why don't you say hello.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
You think this is funny?
Now is that little prick still here, because if he is, I'm gonna rip his fucking <u>heart</u> out!
And you<u>don't</u> tell her.  What you're going to say.
Not use my words, please!
Ice cold water.
No they're not.
Then have a donut --
Queen of diamonds.
Poof!  You're happy now.
What honey?
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
You have the WORST flu since...
No!  I have to get there.
How do you know?
I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
Planning on getting --
I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!
Our children.
Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
We don't have any coffee.
What did you do?
Jackie?
Yes?
Did I hear the word...
Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob...
You bet you are.
And you said...?
And you said...
Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
You weren't passing 'em out.
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
I just found out I have to go to Boston to get a deposition.  I might not be back until Saturday.
For what?
I trust you of course I do but --
And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --
We have the kids.  Next weekend.
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Four brothers and five sisters.
I did not go to high school.
Mi Jesus…mi jesus…
Who is Jesus?
You have a bay?
He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.
How did they execute him?
This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
Not to be crass, but what do we get out of this?
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.
What's tomorrow?
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
Fuck!
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.
You have beautiful skin.
I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
Say, Ni...
...gger.
No, not really.
I hate reading.
'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
I dunno...
Hello, is this Pam?
Oh, fine. How are you?
N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
I do.
Great. How old are they?
Yeah, sure.
You know...I like you.
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
Sure…um…yeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
Y-yes--
We don't have time!
What are you talking about?
Are you going to kill us?
Well?
Who's Ryan Cooper?
Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
He wouldn't take it on the helicopters. He'd transport it through pipelines that connect Chemco to the waterfront...
Something tells me you don't want to be on TV, friend.
Get your men to do it!
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
What's the meaning of this?
And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
You mean you'll tell us his name???
Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left. 
What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
Didn't they tell you?
They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?
Well, that's ridiculous.  If the teleprinter and radio links are out of order, just pick up a phone and pay for a call.
General Schmuck?
To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
Just a second, sir.  He's got films of the War Room in that thing!
Yes, sir.  One thing, Mister President.
I didn't speak to him, sir.  But Colonel "Bat" Guano was in command of the Special Service battalion, so I would imagine he did.
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
This is General Ripper speaking.
Yes, sir.
Why do you think I ask?
That's right, sir.
As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
How much soda, sir.
When he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right.  But today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me, Major?
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
Right.
Go on, Major.
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
Naturally I am, sir.
What's the target.
Roger, maintain.
Check.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
Gee, we hate to leave you like this, Major Kong.  But there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around.
Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---
Check, all bomb circuits green.  Okay, Lothar.
When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?
He's dead, all right.
Recall what mistake?
They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.
Lieutenant Zogg, what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission?
Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
Come on, King.  That doesn't make sense.
Maybe the warning system's out.
Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
I thought I'd go along for the ride.
In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.
I don't anymore.
In Group?
Yeah!
What's it about?
A cloud.
Oh.
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
Where are you-hoo?
It's your birthday?
Pony's coming here to the corner?!
That's the rock star thing.
You wanna bet he's with a girl?
That sounds so depressing.
Ah!
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...
What?
She's dead?
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Glad it's okay.
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
You okay, man? You okay?
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Hi.
He is.
Deep down. Way down.
Taking care of business.
He says we got to be at the radio station at seven a.m. Can you handle that?
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
Mm.
Hi.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
He's drunk.
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
That chick, Erica?
What'd you do?
I hit her.
Yes.
No.
This is my home.
Jeff! Come up here!
Is that Bee-Bee?
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
That's right.
No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What is your name?
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
"The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you.
No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
Of course I do!
Yes, I stand for -
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
And?
No one does nothing, Jeff.
New ground?
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
Mm-mm.
No. No, no, no.
Oh, yeah?
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
I've run out of words.
Wait. What, what are you saying?
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
Do your covers and all that shit.
What?
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
Well, not exactly.
So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you staying at your mother's house?
What do you mean?
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
Ready?
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
So? What's L.A. like?
It's pretty exciting.
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
Alright, alright already.
"Drove down the highway there was a big jam The family had died There inside their minivan There was a backup It went on for miles But as bad as it was It was gone after a while"  Chorus here.  "You may think there's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see To be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be"
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.
What's that supposed to mean?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
Sorry, Kansas...
Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow.
And they get caught!
... so when your dad said, "I never want to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up?
I'm sorry.
No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
...do not accept charity.  We are two young, able-bodied Americans.  We do not want a handout.  We want a hand-up. Give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow.  Give us corn - the kind you plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own food and... and, uh, then cut it, and - uh, y'know eat it!  Now, if you're interested in giving us a home loan, I will sit back down.  If not, have a nice day, Ma'am.
Oh, thank G-d!  I'm not just super fat!
It was Lucy!  Lucy went to the cops!
Bullets.
...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your...
Hannah, in order to get real answers from the netherworld, you've gotta have a Christian virgin run the board.  Your kind is pure of heart - the devil won't dick with you.
Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
Uh...maybe?
I don't hate you.  I need your help.
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
What the hell do you want?
Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page synopsis.  But I wouldn't bother.
Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent.
That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.
Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
Stop it, Artie, will you?  Where have you been keeping your- self? I've got the most wonderful news for you.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
I'm sorry.  I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
What were you -- a child actress?
I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
Nice job.
Why not? Don't you love Artie?
Of course I love him.  I always will.  I'm just not in love with him any more.
Ever been in one of these old Hollywood palazzos? That's from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week, and no taxes.  Careful of these tiles, they're slippery. Valentino used to dance here.
I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
Joe, I can't look at you any more.
Yes, I did.
Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
I wouldn't know.
I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.  I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.
Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
Fair enough.
Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
You'll like it here.
I'll take care of that.
What scene?
Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
I've lost my car.
Shouldn't we wait for the others?
Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
"Mad about the boy."
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
Go away.  Go to that girl of yours.
They're awful.  They make me cough.
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
No you didn't.  You took the car.
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
Wanted what?
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
Goodbye.  Norma.
I just put my car in the garage. I had a blow-out.  I thought --
Suppose you listen just for a minute -
This room has not been used for a long time.
That's what I told them.
How is she?
What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?
Got a title?
Haven't got a thing.
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
What does it mean?
We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
A Storm Dragon?
Eliminate her.
Wait...don't leave me in here...
When can I see, you again ?
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
This is my favourite place in the city.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
Tell me where I can find her.
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
We can't do that.
Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
But why?
Finished your estimate?
I bet they do.
Oh no, not you again.
You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper business.
Do you have any theories about last night?
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."
There is a way.
Then teach me how.
What are you talkin' about?
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
Lana Lang. How great to see you.
You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.
I just can't stand this.
Me??
So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville --
Old ties are hard to cut.
No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
Well...  Not quite like this.
Hi. Mister Kent.  Guess who Mom's having dinner with tonight? Superman!
Yeah.
Dishwasher? Any luck?
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
When?
God, that's what I keep you for.
That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of...
Now...when do I get a taste?
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
What about you?
Why do I have to do this?
Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
But the other night...
Where's the handle?
I don't kiss.
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
What's wrong?
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
Where were you?
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
Oh Clark, no!
Lois, I really don't see why --
You do?
What else is ballast for?
It has everything.
What's a curl?
A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris
I asked the right question.
I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
Wait, wait, wait just a moment. Wait till you've got to know better will you please.  Wait, -- look, I can give you anything you want. I can give you the brass ring, the - er -- unlimited freedom to maim, cure, destroy, chew - plus Lex Luthor's savvy. Lex Luthor's career guidance... Lex Luthor's School of...
It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent.
I'm the man they're 	protecting. I'm the President. I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.
Who is this . . . Superman?
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
Free!
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..
		DELETE IN CUTTING
General --- ?
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
What about here?
That sounds kind of pessimistic.
Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
Yes, darling?
No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
What was that about?
This wasn't in the plan.
You think he'll find us.
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
Superman. . .  But you're... dead!
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.
Unbelievable.
Stop him, Clark!
Know what?
For what? Oh, I've see the way the other half lives. My sister, for instance. it looks terrific, but is that what I really want? Three kids, two cats, and fifteen needlepoint pillows? I'd go bananas after one week. Hell, I need this crazy existence of mine.  Like I need the plague, right? That's what your thinking.
It wasn't a trick!
Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
Superman.  Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
I read the article.
See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
I don't understand.
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
You got wax in your ears?
Where's mine?! Where's my parachute?
You can't do this to me!
But you can't ignore these facts!  It's suicide!  Worse than that, it's genocide.
Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
There are none of them any good anyway.
Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around
Do as I say. Let go!
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
Oh.
How old are you?
Uh-huh.
I...uh...
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
I broke the man out of prison --
Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.
What is this??!
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have  --
Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
That's where I'm going.  To see her.
Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now?  Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  Because that's what I'm about to do.
You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.
Why are you telling me this?
Why are you telling me this?
Hi, Nicole.
They just finished supper.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
It does concern me.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
Sure.
Because I have to.
You talked about it?
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
Were his parents...attentive to him?
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
I did.
You heard what Abbott said?
Yes.
He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole.  He looked frightened.
Away from your crazy Mom.
You want a cup of tea or something?
And winter?
Is this mine?
Was he drinking?  Could you tell?
The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty...
So he was mean?
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
Will you be spending more than a night?
Almost three.
I'm in a car wash.
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
I tested positive.
You've been retained?
Who did they get for that?
Dolores?
Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?
No.
Kyle Lambston's a drunk.  Nobody likes him.  He's a nasty piece of work.
Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart enough.
Before the actual accident?
I was scared.
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
Why were you scared?
How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going?  To the best of your recollection?
You saw the speedometer?
No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
You remember this?
That was great.
Do you like the colour?
Yes.
What's going to happen to Dolores?
Is "he" inside?
Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -
Coupla weeks.  For eight weeks.
I see Bartha gave you cold tongue for supper.  Hey, wait a minute!
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
Just exactly what are you so hot about?  I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!
If looks could kill, I'm dead...
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.
Why?  Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice?  Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?  You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace!
Sidney is a liar!
Who said Sidney?
Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets.  But in her heart of hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. Now, what about YOU, son?  Not just tom-catting around...I hope?
No...
Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!
Mac!  I don't want this man at my table...
Match me, Sidney...
I know Steve.  No.
You're picking up my lingo, hon.
Can't hurt...
Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job.
And who's feet is she on now?
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...
Is Frank D'Angelo around?
And he's a perfect stranger to me.
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
I didn't do anything!
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process --
No good.
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people!
What?
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
Not even of dying?
Out of the way, John!
I love you, John.  I always have.
I know!
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
The CPU from the first terminator.
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
Relax now, Sarah --
You represent the United States now. We have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just.
That's because you had a proper upbringing.
That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!
I'm Steve. What's your name?
I guess so, sir.
So what is it?
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have?
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
You bet.
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwängler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
Not yet.
Furtwängler's in a different category.
You live here, in Berlin?
Steve.
Mine's the Eleventh.
That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.
Sure.
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwängler, do you know Hans Hinkel?
Who?
I wasn't told. I just knew it.
He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.
What telegram?
I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
Do you know what that is?
I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
I've remembered something else...
You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.
Right. Claims assessor.
They said I was dogged?
Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section since 1936. What instrument did you play?
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Can you handle it?
Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.
What do you think?
It's okay.  Forget it.
What?
You'll learn.
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
I bet you're ticklish.
Here, drink some of this...
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--
Here's her driver's license.
That stuff's two hours cold.
Call her.
But, the expectation was ten.  And, in this case, expectation is everything.
Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
The stock will turn.
It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
Clean out your locker.
Oh, God... !
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
Home.
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
I'll give you a boost.
It's much easier this way.  Come on, step up...
This is C.R.S.
Don't panic.  When security gets here, we simply explain what happened...
Goodnight.
Then, what good are you?
I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
My name's not Christine.  It's not my real...
I don't know.  A lot.
Get us out of here...
Where'd you get that... ?
He's got a gun.  Everyone, he's got a <u>real</u> gun up here!  Real situation!  ... damn it...
What are you doing?
Listen very carefully, I'm telling the truth... this is the game.  This was all the game.
Don't move, you bitch... !
Like... where are you from?
One brother, one sister.
They'll be wanting it back.
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
No.
Will you?
But, will you?
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
It doesn't stop, Nick.  I paid the bill, I gave 'em their money, but it all started again.  They won't leave me alone...
We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.
No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense!
What?
Really?
Yeah.
Have you gone to the police?
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
It was a different floor then...
I need the police.
Not much, I think.
What?
Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
Couldn't get the last ones.  You?
Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting.
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
You're not telling us something.
Was sure she'd be in here.
She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
You wrote that you had trouble sleeping.
All the carvings.
Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
It was very specific.
What is that tune?
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
Get a blanket!
I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you?
Why do you need a chain like that?
Is there something about the house?
That's where she hanged herself.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
It's all I could afford.
That's why we're here.
I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.
Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
I'm not.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
Why?
We all did.
When you find the guy, you'll know.
No, not my girl.  Self-control, she had. Point of pride.  And people don't change, do they.
Y'what?
You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.
Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
You hadda show up on a weekend.  This weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.
No one else is even here yet.
He's gotta know why.
What d'you say, Elaine?
Not much -- you?
You look alike.
Not her brand.
Been busy, have you.
It's been a while.
Here, aren't you gonna let me in.
You weren't disappointed in her, then.
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...
What's that, like a P.O. box.
-- Your employer?
Depends, don' it.
On what.  What makes you so certain.
Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night.  She called me, asked if she could come over.  She and Terry had been -- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't know about what.  On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
Did you.  What was that in aid of?
You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?
I've 'ardly ever left it.
Not that I recall.
Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.
Where's Big Sur?
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.
So what's your beef, pal?
Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
Deals?  My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific.
Yeah?
No kidding.
Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
Been away a lot.
How much.
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.
And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
What?
You do?
I don't get it.
How we gonna get that lucky?
You know her?
Since when?
Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
Ah.
I don't.
Thanks.  You, too.
What.
Tell you ...
She could've had the deal!  I would've handed it to her if she wanted.  I would have given her everything.
...I'm so sorry about your loss.
Yes?
Ah yes, a music lover.
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
...I didn't recognize you without the smock. Did I--damn--did I leave something at the shop?
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer--
How ya doin', Ed?
Mm.
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
...What kind of man *are* you?
I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.
Told what?
Who?
...What's so damn strange about that?
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.
...Doris--
Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?
I knew about it. Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money.
OK, how did you know?
Oh, hell. Drink?
'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender.
Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
Ed, how're you holding up?
...Huh?
I don't work here. My wife does.
...You ever wonder about it?
Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries.
Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!
Ah.
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
It better be good.
There's some kind of animal loose in the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He needs help.  I want volunteers to go with me.
Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan.  Move.
I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
Behind you.
It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
Careful.  That mess on the ground is brains.
An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I have a copy of this in my office at home.
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
I believe in you a hundred percent, Vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection.
Dr. John Whittlesley.
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
Yes.  Bit of a shock.  But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood.  And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era --
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
What is it?
I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
"Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight.  "External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust.  Aggressiveness: extreme."
I'm coming with you.
Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.
Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.
Oh no.  I smell it.
If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.
What do you make of it, Margo?
4-monoxytocin is... "A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland."
Is Dr. Frock safe!
Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John.  Is he really dead?
That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.
He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
That's not what I saw.
Dr. Green...
What was it?
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
What happened?
You smell that?
You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
Today.
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?
We've declared a curfew.  Everyone else is at first positions.
I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.
Cue music...
What music?
He doesn't care.
Thank you.
--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.
Let's talk ratings.  "Truman" has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few days--how do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself?
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
And the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.
No, of course not.  And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement.
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
You think she'd go through with it?
No.
Well, what do you want to do?
It's beautiful!  What are you waiting for?
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
I've got to talk to you.
I think he's alive.  I'll tell you about it later.  I'm definitely being followed.
What're we doing here, Truman?
What exactly?
That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
What's that?
Well, what do you think?
How did it go today?
I won't be late.
I've been thinking--
I have to talk with you.  But not here.  Let's go for a walk.
So why do you want to go?
Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.
I'll try.
There's no one here.
--How do you know about that?
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
Do you live around here?
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
Special Agent Scully --
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
And if it's unsuccessful?
Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
Who?
Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?
The Federal Building was too well guarded.
Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
I think you're full of shit.
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
-- You saw this experiment?
I've been using you?!
You didn't know my father --
Where are you, Scully?
Did you find something?
What's wrong, Scully?
I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.
Scully...
They were the ones that put us together.
No.
And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
Why are you whispering?
I can't really talk right now.
Evidence of a massive infection.
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
All the equipment is brand new.
Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
You think they went left?
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
Scully....?
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately.
Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.
Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully.
Where's Scully?
A virus?
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  Or it may not.
I'd be there for him.
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
I don't need them anymore...
I realize that...
With Stargher I saw things...
Why'd you bring him here?
If you believe that.
What happened?
Mocky-Lock.
I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
Any psychiatric medication?
That's a secret.
How's the patient.
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
...at all.
Oh, that was many years ago.
...and buried him.
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
Are you going, too?
How do you know?
Oh, the usual things...
Joseph Harbin...
He works in a military hospital.
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
I don't want it.
Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major?
Martins.
Miss Schmidt.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.
Calloway!
A girl of spirit.
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
Wait a minute - let me out.
Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.
Very good, sir.
Do you know his number?
Come upstairs a moment.
I know a very good dentist.
Mr. Crabbin.
She's been arrested.
You really liked it?
Not yet.
Vinkel.
Coming to the point, please.
...he was. Yes, for a short time, while they carried him across the road.
Mr. Lime - yes.
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
You saw it?
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
...Mr. Martins?
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
I'm Daffy.
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.
I don't know - I'm American.
So?
Two.
No.
You think?! Based on what?
Fucking Danny, man...
What??
I have a job.
Forget the Jewish stuff. It doesn't play anymore.  There's only the market, now, and it doesn't care who you are.
No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
Too difficult?
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
Why not?
It looks a little like a swastika.
They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...  How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
The sex is better.
V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing?
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
Don't curse in front of it.
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
Miriam called, looking for you. She said you might come, so I...
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
They left an hour ago.  You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on.  How soon can you get back to the city?
We want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream: works like <i>The Bell Curve</i>, <i>Sociobiology</i>, anti-Zionism, anti- immigration, the com-munitarian issue.... We'll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, Jews. Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch, Shahack....
Is it okay if I record this?
Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.
Are all Jews the same?
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
What were you, following me?
To hear them read Torah.
It was a nine millimeter.
I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
Balint?
From the Rhineland originally.
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
That's meat.
The Bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. But chickens don't give milk.
He's going to die.  He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around.  I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
Get out of here....
What is it?
You said they didn't have night guards.
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
Why me?
Dennis Leary.
Fund-raising??
Johana, am I boring you?
Congratulations.
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
Don't.
Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  And he's only waiting for one thing:  that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
Enzo, what are you going to do with the money?
It isn't lit yet.
It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
I dove 315 feet!
So, not married.  Well, good for you.  You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?
What?
Can I come in?
I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
I'm going back home.
No... tell me.
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
What?
Assassin!
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
Again?
What are they for?
They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
... And those?
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
Who... Who is that?
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
Looks like I got a plane to catch.
So. Do you have a name?
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
Sorry. I'm better with men.
What are you doing here?
Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.
Cool. What's it do?
A stereo type alarm system?
Sorry folks, I don't do couples.
When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.
Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and —-
Mmm———yes.
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
Sure.
And here is Three Tree Mesa -- and here I go out of the big arroyo --
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life —- and I still don't know what the Procession means.
Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
It doesn't jibe with this —— you told me the leopard would go out into the country —- it wouldn't stay in the city ——
It could be a man.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --
Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
Wait ——
Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --
That's a fact, isn't it?
Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
What else do you care about, Kicks?
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
No. No, thanks.  Now we've got to do it ourselves.
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside -— where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
Hot...  These roads all round here, closed to the public... Why’s that? Military bases?  Huh. I guess there’s space enough for war games... Must be good for business.
Will you please come with me?
Now you know why you’re here, Mr Lombard.  It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.
And that is the last time any...
I don’t know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
I found this at your brother’s.
Have you got a pen?
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
You know he’d have had him killed, don’t you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
Whatever the reason, I’m sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child supplier’s being tailed?
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But it’s never that complicated really.
Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.
We? You and your parents killed your husband?
I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what we’re doing here?
Thank you. But I think I’ll go to bed. It’s been a long day.
Right... Well, I’ll get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think I’ll get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, it’ll be too late.
Whitney Armstrong, my deputy. What Whitney’s trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your Austrian...
Who’s the money man?
Where?
Where are we?
What colour is your car?  What colour is your car?
Must be your lucky day then. I’ve got your accounts - you don’t owe much tax for last year.
Should I?
She’s pretty... See you, huh?
What if it is?
Recommended?
Didn’t you say I came recommended?  That’s what I thought. May I know by whom?
Look Mrs Spitz... I don’t know to whom I’m indebted for the recommendation but... I’m not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
I presume you checked your son’s apartment...
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about.  His address is in this envelope with Leonard’s address, keys and other things you might need. 
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who can’t do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
I’m overcome by your public-spiritedness.
Will you be alone?  The merchandise. Is it just you or...
Evening. Table for one?
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
Shut up! Where’s your wallet?
Haven’t you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? I’d have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
His mother would be pleased to hear that.
They’re German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. It’s not guilt, more of a curse...  And then there’s something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think that’s just one of Leon’s dark delusions...
I’m sorry. It’s just you don’t look local...
I’ve been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
Los Angeles?
Barstow’s 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever you’re heading, I reckon somebody’ll pick you up.
Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I don’t really know her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at Camden. That’s how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha...
What’s an hour of your time worth these days, Nathalie?  Combien, Nathalie!
Bye. And thanks... Nathalie gently closes the door, eyes Lombard who shakes himself awake... rolls her eyes and surveys the room...
Okay, shitbag. I’m only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Figlio di puttana. You’re the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
Fuck...
Three...
Huh! You turned him into a liability, didn’t you know?
Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldn’t go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only ‘cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasn’t easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, what’s your business with these Spitzes?
Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
It's a miracle she's not dead!
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
I also need someone who can read and write.
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
Alright... I promise to rest if you promise... to go back to the battle.
Jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? Are you alright?
Yes...
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
One day you will.
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
Go onto the next question.
I tried to.
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
No!  I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
Calm down, my lord, I beg you!
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
The voice was in your cell?
Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
Buying her?
Your majesty, I really think you...
That's not a lot.
8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
So... what is the message?
Well...?  Shall we go?
Not yet.
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
Clear?
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
The clothes are not important...
You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  It proves your desire to deceive...
No...!
That's now what I meant...
But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
We... won?!
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...
Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
What signs?
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
What for?
Are you going to leave me too?
You know I'm always happy to see you, Jeanne, but to keep coming here twice, three times a day...
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
Oh yes... very.
Then... why are you here so often?
Who is this "he"?
He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself.  Do you think he's coming from the sky?
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
Wladek, please.
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
Let me see this.
For what? For my tie?
Must feel better this side of the wall.
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
Get your things together, you have to leave!
What's happened?
Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
wish I knew you better.
Believe me, they've picked him up.
But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
What are you reading?
No one thought they'd hold out so long.
should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
But I want to help, I want to.
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
I am... I was a pianist.
Where are you hiding?
Are the Russians here?
What about you?
Careful! Watch his hand.
She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
She looks tired.
They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of it?
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
She wants to see what you can do.
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
What do we do?
No.
Listen Duke, we're setting up a wire store.  I need a twenty man boost right away.
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
Twist, you know this guy?
You're late.  Where you been?
I had some appointments.
What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
What the hell you gonna do with yourself?
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
We cleared 22 here.
Hey, Luther told me he was carrying a wad, but I didn't figure this much.
We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.
What the hell you gonna do when Snyder rushes his finger right to Lonnegan?  You're committin' suicide, kid.
Been a while since I stocked a wire store.  Not many mobs playing that anymore.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.
You mean you blew it.
Lonnegan after you, too?
I wanna play for Lonnegan.
This isn't like playin' winos on the street.  You gotta do more than outrun the guy.
You think he'll show?
It was too noisy.
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
I'm not sure I know it.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
A half mill on an eight to one shot. You're dumber than I thought, Lonnegan.
Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.
You done?
Where you goin'?
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
Why me?  Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from.
Well, what did I tell ya?
Why don't ya then.
You got the 400 grand yet?
Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.
What is this?  I got work to do.
Why don't you pick him up yourself?
He'll never do it.
Come on, gimme a break.
Then just say he was sixty years old.
Is that what it means?
Cheer up, darling.
How are you?
I can't help it.  You don't know.....
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
Dorothy!
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
You're high enough.
I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
He's waiting for you.
Not that scrawny little....? 
How did you ever remember me?
That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
Where did you hit her?
She... she fell over backwards.
He'll still be your son-in-law!
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
I'd like to see him.  Why don't you bring him down?
Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
But it isn't bad weather now.
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
You oughtn't to play this trick on me.  Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
Who's your candidate?
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
Shut up.
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
Oh, then you did hear from him?
When was that?
I see.
Want to take a poke at him?
I couldn't go near that woman.
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
and there she was lying dead.  The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.
That's my business.
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
But suppose some business comes up...
How are you?
Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
You don't say --
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
You did... where?
I didn't knock Julia off.
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
Hello, baby.
Who is she?
Six Martinis.
I'd better order some food.  That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?
Good. I want to talk to you.
They were kidding you.
It's all right.  It just grazed me.
I'll be all right. Don't let's fuss till the doctor comes.
You're a fine watch dog.
Did I give it to you?
Your guess is as good as mine.
The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
But Wynant --- ?
Looks like a hold-up!
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
You bet I wouldn't.
You dog!
Goodbye, darling.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
He was down in the shop.
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
Why not?
Got a nice evening dress?
I've got a lulu -- why?
The suspects!  They won't come.
Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
Nick Charles here?
I know I left them there.
Home?
What's in the other direction?
Think we're going to do it?  Think we're going to war?
Like learning Arabic?  You're gonna learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here.
What's it say?
What?
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
You just go when I say go.
All right.  Let's get out of here.
Epps!
You're out of your mind.
We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger are AWOL.  We have no authority--
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
You disappoint me, Epps.  Always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy.  I had respect for you.
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.
It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--
We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.
It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
They're not going to--
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
What?
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
What do we do with the Humvee?
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
You didn't step on any mine.
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
You're going to blow yourselves up.
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
Don't!
X marks the spot.
Something like that.
If they land--
Must be a compartment.
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
No.
First Wes, now you?
Yeah.
Getting cold.
Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
What do you figure it is?
Well?
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!
An Iraqi?
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
When did you make the switch?
Yeah.
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
Really?
Some good ones.
Now you need me.
Yeah, you're funny.
Naw, nothing.
What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?
It's...it's...I don't know what it is.
God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.
This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
Oh, God!
Yeah!  Yeah!
We have to go back.
We're American soldiers.  We don't abandon people.
Think we can make it?
You down?
Maybe we should give him some water.
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
triple three, triple three! easy.....
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
4000 degrees is usually the point of....?
Then why did you bring it up?
I said what time is it?  How long was I out?
No!  Don't go.
I couldn't turn you in, not now. I....I know I wouldn't!
They know.  They've been watching us.  I can feel it.
Then why are they holding us here? Why don't they destroy us right away?  Economically, it's not sound at all.  Very much unlike....
What's going on....what are you doing?
Wait!  I'll talk to him.
I've got it!  Astounding!
I want you for my roommate.
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.
...it doesn't matter.  The rest of it just didn't happen.
No......  She's dead THX........
Coffee, Mike?
Aren't you on suspension?
Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.
Look, it's a longshot...
How long were you hooked?
What's up?
Fuck factor?
C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!
Nothing.
Then why tell me?
Drop it.
Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...
What was it this time?
A what?
I'll do it.
What's this?
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
Pardon me, m'sieu. Madame Colet would like to see you in the living room.
M'sieu Laval, M'sieu Filiba would like very much to see you.
About tonsils.
You've never been in Constantinople?
Good morning, Major.
Umm.
You're looking fine, Major.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
Um-hum ...
And you, M'sieu Giron, seem to be disturbing my examination of <u>this</u> <u>report</u>.
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
I'm very sorry, but this is no time, M'sieu Giron--
Otherwise I'll call the police
Then why didn't you call the police? Why <u>don't</u> you call the police?  I'll tell you why--you crook, you.
M'sieu ...
Good day, Doctor.
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
Thank you.
Last year? It can't be that long.
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
Yes.
You like that statue?
Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
Make it out to cash!
Eighteenth century.
Yes!
Oh? 
Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--
Um-hum ...
Together.
Hair?
Marvelous.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
<u>Adolph</u>?
Oh, M'sieu Laval ...
Yes--uh--
Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...
Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
Please!  Thank you.
You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
Yes, madame?
Well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty?
That's true.
Because I hate him--because I love you!
You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
Yes, my bag!
No--I'm sorry.
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
There's a satellite call for you.
An accident?!
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
Cor... look at that, would ya.
I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
Hello again.
Jack.
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
And these were drawn from life?
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
A whole ten cents?!
A mistake?
Could it have damaged the ship?
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
Is your stateroom alright?
It's so unfair.
Anya, I think you're crazy.
But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.
I'll join you later.
Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do--
No-o!
Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.
You're coming back--
I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
Well, I'll be--!!!
Not here--follow me around the shed.
Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett.
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
You keep it-- 
Don't worry about that.  We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?
Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
I thought you were a sucker--
I'm going to the show--
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
Sure, I'll go.
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.
Where do you live?
In New York.
Send that.
Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
That's me!
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
Is this your gun?
Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
No--not much--excepting-- 
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?
You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
Why--don't you like him?
What's the matter, Mary?
Is that one of the Who's Who?
Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--
Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
You get wise to <U>yourself</U>! If you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get that!--And what're you going to do about it?
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
No!
Why?
I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--
It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.
Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.
Telegrams.
Nothin'.
Then why did you run away?
I said that's 500 to you, Holliday.  In or out?
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me.  Good day.
Yeah, you look it.
Age quod agis.
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
Here, Doc.
Since when is faro a business?
Very cosmopolitan.
Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney.  Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome.  You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds.
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.
I'm your man...  You win again.  Well played, sir. You are on fire.
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.
Good God, you're really-
We've never actually met.  My Name's-
I laugh sometimes
Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy?
You know this is adultery.  You Burn in hell for that.
I have to go.
What can I get you?
Those Cowboys're tellin' Everybody in town they're gonna Clean you out.  They're down in That lot right now behind the OK Corral.
I don't know.  I'm all right.
Look, Mattie, I know you're-
That what you got me up here for?
'Least they don't scare women.
No?  Brothers to the bone, right?
I ain't your brother, I ain't None of your damn brothers.  Move!
There they are.  No herd though.
Give him some good exercise?  Sure Some stud.  Some string in fact. What're you gonna do, race 'em?
Really?  What about hell?  They got A sign or what?
Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served.  That means we got the Cowboys without quarter.  The Black flag, brother.  No Prisoners, no mercy, amen.
Well that's your problem.  Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?
Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.
I appreciate your assistance, M. But this is now a military operation.
Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.
My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese.  His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai...  His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper.  It was a city of unlimited possibility.
...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
...And what's that, my dear?
I'd rather die alone.
I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
4:30. It may take me a little longer to wrap things up here.
Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
Wait a minute -
What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much time to demonstrate your new Q toys.
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
Hey - the world is my office.
What do you want with the Harbor Master?
Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me.
Thanks.  Take care -
- You're not.
He's killed closer.
You are seriously deranged.
Thank you Colonel Everhart.  007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information?
- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -
The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
What's your name?
Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.
What is HE doing here?
What about ID's?
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
What did your wife get her?
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
What is a sip of coffee going to do?
Why don't you come in for a while?
He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
It was nip and tuck.
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.
It is just a regular card.
You all act like two roosters.
I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.
How is the garden doing?
Boy, that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom.
It's the boy next door throwing at his birds. I'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.
Stranger my foot, it was my grandmother who helped you into this world.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
Let me get you a cup?
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
Those boys never did have good luck.
That's nice.
How many people do you all feed?
Harry, that's not nice. I'm in church now.
Is this your house?
What's a toby?
Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.
Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
He is in his pigeon cage.
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
What?  What is it?
Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
No, you can't.
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
What's going on?
You mean it has hyperdrive?
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
Oh, I'm a sham!!
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
Woody!  It's the moving van.
Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
Hey, watch it!
No she's NOT --
Did you all take stupid pills this morning?!  Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?  And now you want to let him back over here?
No wait!  You don't understand! Buzz is out there!  We've gotta help him!!
ROOAAAARR!!!
Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond!
What the heck is up there?
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you?
Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
He's a pyjama case, really.
He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
How much do I pay him?
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people.  Only Carl knows who they are.  That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't know Ruiz.  Church and State.
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
Did you get it?
So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise.  Superfund is just one of those words.  People stop paying attention.
I think she's lying.
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
Me, too.
God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?
My Leica's gone.
Where are you going?
How's David?
We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you --
Helena --
What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.
You can't make me.
...How old are you?
Yes.
In school?
How are your grades?
I get A's.  All A's.
You should see little Montel play. Little Montel is the next Maradona.
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
You expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
Yeah.
Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.
Javi!  Come on.  Don't pull this you don't care bullshit.  This is incredible information.  It must be. Javi --
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
The busiest land border crossing in the world.  Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot.  I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.
What do you look for?
Any way we can do it better?
She's not at that place you sent her?
Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?
What do you mean?
What do we do?  Okay.  Fucked-up Bowman's turning blue.  Doctor.  We need a doctor.
Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --
Well, why didn't you bring them?
I want the money, Mark, that's all.
Shag her senseless.
I'm no a fucking buftie and that's the end of it.
Yes, you fucking do. I've seen your statement.
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
Can I see you again?
It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.
So why have you told me about it?
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
Sixteen next month.
So, what's he like?
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am.
Are you getting out much?
Aye.
Thanks, Mark.
If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right?
Nightmare.
I would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every sense, with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster, but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead, closer in that respect to Cary Grant.
But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.
The park?
It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life.
So who else?
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
It was my fucking television.
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.
No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.
You'll have to send us a postcard.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
Six weeks and no sex?
Well, what are you waiting for?
What do you see as your main strengths?
With a starship!
It could. Yes.
He has his doubts...
Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.
Sulu, what are you doing?
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.
Ah, Captain?
On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?
I do not often think of the past.
Why?
Captain, what have I done -
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
I am here, Captain.
Spock... the booster rockets.
Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart  Spock?
Sha Ka Ree. "The Scource." "Heaven." "Eden." call it "Qui'Tu." To the Romulans, it's "Vorta Vor." The Andorian word is.. unpronounceable. Still, every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang. For us, that place will soon be a reality.
I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
Sybok, we must find a way...
Way to go! We're haulin'!
I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
Well I want to communicate --
What, just the three of us?
You're alive!
Then...
There's another beam!
You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.
Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
How?
I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.
Where are you going?
Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late.
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
Dana, are you listening to me?
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
She knows not to steal.  I've taught her better than that.
Copy that.
Son of a bitch!
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
It can't be.
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
But you didn't.  Why not?
My husband is a good man.
Yes what?
This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty.
I'm late.
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
I'm sorry.  Thank you for the party.
...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.
What did happen?
Let me out of her!  Right now!
Do you still love your husband?
Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--
What were you doing there?
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
God, you have great legs.
Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.
Oh shit.
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.
Sorry.  Trade secret.
What about the husbands?
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then?
Get going! 
I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are?
Were they trying to kill you?					*
Not yet.
Let me speak to Clarence.
I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs.
Tell him we gotta go.
Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.
Thanks a lot.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
Sonny kicks ass.
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
Wow. What a swell place to work.
How long have you worked here?
Do you get paid a lot?
God, Spiderman looks different.
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?
You mean she got a bad batch?
You're a whore?
My pimp.
You have a pimp?
You better not be fucking teasing me.
Did ya ever see "The Chinese Professionals"?
What?
I think what you did was...
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
You wanna get unhaunted?
You'd really do that?
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
She's with me.
Clarence sent a letter?
Money problems?
How much of that letter was on the up and up?
It's fuckin' real!  It's fuckin' real!
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
What'd'ya tell 'em?
Yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass.  Come on, Clarence, lets go. Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby.
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
No. But thanks.
Leave the gorillas.
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
What do you think, eightball?
No. No, you don't.
He wants to talk ya.
Yeah?
You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
She seems very nice.
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
Keep it.
I give up. Who are you?
I'm me... I mean, that's me.
Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -
But a fuckin' baggie.
Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.
He's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the show must go on.
Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.
You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
Naw, man, it ain't white boy day.
I'll keep lover boy here entertained.  You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's done it before. But I want you as a audience.  Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?
Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!
Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?
You gotta hold this for me.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
Well?
Women will want to get to know you...
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
This is April, right?
July?!
You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
My father told me that.  "Never cry wolf."  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.
You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
My notes.  Observations.  Clues.
A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.  I've told you about them. They spread the virus.  That's why we have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to find them -- it's my assignment.
They're keeping an eye on me.
James, why don't we...?
You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
Give me the gun.
James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend you don't know me.  If he sees you...
Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?
The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?
It was?  I didn't...know.
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
You... you left them a message?
You... you couldn't have heard me.
I'm not crazy.
Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
JOSE!
I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
More or less.
That's my morning's pay.
You ain't nothing but an old fool.
It's nonsense.
Out of here.
One way, or round trip?
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Don't look like nothing.
Look, I just want to pick up my car.
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
You believe that?
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
Let me have a Beck's.
I think I burned my gun hand!
That wasn't so bad.  What's thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you?  It didn't hurt a bit.
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
How could I?  I was sleeping.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
What do you do anyway?
Those are white words, not ours.
Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
No.
Depends on what you call love.  When I was growing up I had nothing.  I learned to want everything.  I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket.  He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together.  I courted him.  I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line.  I wanted him.  I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him.  Is that love?
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
How far is it to California?
I can't.
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
I wanted to talk.
There is no us, remember?
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Oh, that's great.  We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!
If you want.
Let's go in the bedroom.
Let's do it here.
Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you.
Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.
He was a crooked bastard.  He would have killed us.
I'm here.
What for?
The trunk.  It's locked.
It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
Someone will find me.
For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
A lot that means.
Would you?
Why would I kill her?
I was hoping we could talk.
Talk?  About what?
And for that you'd kill Grace?
I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course.  Which is?
The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way.  Now listen to me:  It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing.  If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
You're out in the desert, the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time wasn't right?  What's the matter?  You were hoping to get it on home video?  A keepsake for the grandkids.  Thank God I waited, or I never would have gotten it on tape.
Drop it, Jake.
Yeah, well, me too.
You could say.  I don't even have it yet.
It's not like that.
There's another reason?  It better be good.
I came to kill her.
I'm curious about something.  I'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
What the hell are you doing?  Are you crazy?
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
Give it to me!
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
A hundred-forty-five really.
Do you understand me you little fuck?
Fucking kid.  And look at you; breaking fucking pencils.  You're a Neanderthal.
Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
I guess.
No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
Eh?
But, Senor--
Hey!  You there!
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Hell no!
What do you want for free?
You afraid of the dark?
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
A lot that means.
Accident.
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
That's a solid name.
Would you?
I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
I'm not rambling.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
It's not what you think, Jake.
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior.  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
Two-hundred dollars?
Got any requests?
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
You own this place?
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
Great!
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't worth a duck's fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this .
You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
No charge.
Yeah, but it was shot.
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
Eh?
No, I've got it.
You're not from around here, are you?
I just drove in this morning.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You must be good.
Are there snakes out here?
I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?
All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
I don't know how.
Walk away.
Nothing.
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
Are you sure?...  About me, I mean?
Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?
So, aren't you going to ask me?
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
I busted my leg!
And I love you too.
Harlin's.
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
The old lady?
A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
Out of here.
Heineken?
My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
Who was that on the phone?
You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
You didn't hear something?
How old is Jeb?
I've come to a decision.
I remember you.
I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.  I think that was the first time.  Does that count?
Are you for real?
I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.
I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.
Yeah?
Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
I mean if you knew karate?
I'm not scared.
Against a window.
Now you're going to have to tell me more.
How so?
Is this a religious thing?
You told them cowboys you had it.
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.
Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
...wouldn't let you settle it, huh?
I thought... you was an angel.
I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?
I thought I was gone. See them birds? Most times I wouldn't even notice them birds much. But I'm noticin' 'em real good 'cause I thought I was dead.
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
Are you really going to kill them?
Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
Mmmm pistols.
We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff, out by Cow Creek, we...
Alive?
Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
Yup.
You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 
You could run off them two cowboys.
I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
The... Duck of Death.
You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
Who killed him?
About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
What'd Ned say?
For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
Don't tell nobody about the reward an' all. Don't need no other gunmen tryin' to collect.
Huh?
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
Finish him, Ned.
Did you kill him?
What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on?
They takin' water?
Yeah, I guess so.
That was... the first one.
First one what?
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
It ain't nothin', don't fret it.  She don't like it much, you goin' off with me.
Some fucker's shootin' at us.
HEY.
Jesus.
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
I seen him.
You want the Spencer, Bill? 
N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
He's blind, for Chri...
His pistol must of jammed.
He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?
Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
Maybe.
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
Umm ...
This is not right.
How are they going to do it?
We'll make it.
Mr. Soze will be most -
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
When does he post bail?
I'11 find him.
If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.
I know he was good.
He loved her.
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
Kobayashi.
And this is why you never told the D.A.
What call?
Then why didn't you help him?
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
I don't
You think he's..?
Counselor, you're insulting me.
Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?
Yes.
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
... tell me about this case.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
... here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy ...
Yes.
...I was one of a group of...
That's right.
Yes!
Orthopedics?
How old are you?
Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Huh!
Mr. Concannon...?
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
You would not...?
I thought I would need it.
What is this going to cost?
Is that what a good doctor would do?  How old are you, please?
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
'Code Blue'...
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anaesthetic.  Ideally a  patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic.'  Does that sound familiar?
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.'  General textbook on the subject.  Is  that correct?
Her doctors killed her.
No.
I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
My client can't walk, your Honor.
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar.  Representing my client. My client, do you understand?  You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Nothing further, your Honor...
Exception!
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
D'you find an apartment?
The TV didn't work.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
I've got to work.
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Not if you don't grow up...
Thank you.
I have to talk to you.
I'm going to help her.
Jimmy?  Bushmills.   Lookit, do me a favor.  I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
Yeah?  How's our new witness?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
The Doctors.
It's locked.
But what can we do?  She don't know who's visiting her ...
I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...
One hour.
...of the procedures...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    And they resume seven minutes...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
You don't have to do it for a living.
And you like it.
No, I'm all right.
Not what you think. We're very happily married.
You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
What about?
You.
-- and how you happen to be living here.
It's a place to live, that's all.
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
But Scottie, you don't have to!
But I like that one, Scottie.
It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.
Can't you see?
But why? Why here?
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
Scottie --
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
We're going up the tower.
You can't. You're afraid!
Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?
I made it.
Do you remember where you were?
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
Why?
Where had you been before?
This afternoon.
Oh... wandering about.
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
Wandering about.
Wander about.
Some people prefer it.
Oh! Yes. Hello.
You've nothing to apologize for.
Do you know where you're going?
No!
Vaguely...
What else?
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
No.
Why? What's happened?
You've been there before. You've seen it.
My love... because I love you.
No... we're together...
Why?
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
More than you think.
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
Aren't you ever going to get married?
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
Is she pretty?
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
How soon can it be altered?
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
About anybody but yourself. You never have.
Go home!
I'm calling the police.
Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
We can't do this.
We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
What does that mean?
Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
Who? What are you talking about?
Don't snap at them!
They're driving me nuts!
Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.
There is no candy!
I know...
No way.
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
What are you talking about?
You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
Nothing happened in Vegas.
So who's the lucky guy?
Oh, Jesus...call the police.
All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
He is not cracking up.
I don't know! I just want to get married.
What you just said. Say it again.
Fine? Fine what?
Whatever you say Kojak.
You're sick.
Not true.
And what happens when you can't?
They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?
The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?
What do you mean, you think so?
Why what?
Why did you forget the tent check?
I wouldn't know.
How do you figure?
He is.
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
You expect more what?
I've seen it on television.
You go down there.
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
What are you doing?
Nesting?
What about the chairs?
Okay.
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
Do you love me?
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
The prostitute.
Micheal, by accident.
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
The only proof is those bodies.
What?
Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."
What does that mean?
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".
No...No.
Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head.
The first day.
Pup corn?
Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?
Didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding?
Two.
Are there many windows?
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
What do you mean?
Don't you ever see him?
If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell.
Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house.
Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.
All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this.  Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go.
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
Is it all right?
She's mad.
If you wake first, wake me up.
She isn't my cousin.
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
I don't know -- they've always been there.
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
Leave him alone.
No.
Then let him go and he'll follow you.
They're varicose veins, miss, but some days I can't take care of them.
Are your parents alive?
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
Why not?
I've just had a letter from your uncle. He won't be able to come when you take your vows.
Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?
When you are, miss.
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
Have I slept long?
If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
What about them?
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?
Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.  So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.
Their weapons missing?
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
Not from in here.
Enough to level an entire city block.
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
How does he know who I am?
Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
Coordinated by polymer neural net.
As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
Should I have?
How can I ever thank—you for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
You actually listen to all those tapes?
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
Go to hell.
I don't need a baby—sitter.
Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive.  Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie.
It wasn't a lie.
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
Enjoying yourself?
You're not capable of it.
If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.
...I think so...You?
More or less.
Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?
What if he's busy tonight?
It's <u>producing</u>.

Please, no thanks... 
If I'm closing out this account. If he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it.
Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?

Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.
Speak English will ya.
Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.
You sure about this FAA announcement?
...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.
No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.
Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of Gordon's.
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
What? How do you know about my father?
I don't understand.
He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs.
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
...Gordon.
I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien...
Aha. Poet or philosopher?
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
If I could have anything... this would almost do.
So, how did your conference go with Gordon?
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
...isn't it perfect!
I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.
I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
With Mark?
Yeah, yeah, OK
But?
We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?
Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
Hmm.
Your books Master Loftmore
Thank you
No?
She went to a waxwork party
Then why do you still like her?
You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
This time I really don't see anyone man.
Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
I know that.
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
No.  But once I heard...
How do you know it's a she?
What does she look like?
Yes, but...
Your friend saw them.
Of course.  You must be so proud.
For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.
Um...
I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
Tell me.  Please.
You do?
Thank you.
Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
What's your name?
Well good.  So you're human.
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
Know what I think?
Jody, no...
The planchette?
I think so
No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
Okay.  Okay.
Why?
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
You did a great job.  She's a good kid.
I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
Mmnph.
Oh.
Claire?
Think I may have cracked it.
What's going on, Claire?
A flare?
Where is she then?
Dressed?
...like it never even happened...
You're not at the center.
Who did?
How did you--
But then you've been so much better...
Yep.
You know I am.
I take it your not mad at me.
I was there.
So you fucked a student?!
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
Leave her out of this!
She can't be here without me.
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
Huh.
I'm cooking you dinner.
I have seen him again.  Last night.

I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
I beg your par---
Eighty million doll --- ?
What is it...?
Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
You - are - a - murderer.
I'll tell OR we're bringing -
you crave what I might show you.  What you can learn.  What I can give you.  So much more than Michael can.
What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt..
Like this...  LIKE THIS...?
Yessss...
They like you ------- kids.
I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.
you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?
Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.
Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here.
I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay.
Their what...?
Gee - look at that.  I didn't know alligators came this far up on shore
Your beneficence.
Michael - why would he want to hurt Stu...?
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.
Something's wrong with you.
Hi.    You - you wanna get some breakfast...?  Maybe see a movie...?
You've gone away from me, Ro...  Someplace I don't know how to get to.
That's not good enough.  Why not...?!
I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there!
You okay...?
Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
We'd better get to work on the papers.
I heard something like that
CHIC MAGAZINE?
When could I look round?
Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
Yes, I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job
All the time?
Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?
I lost the touch
Do you take sugar?
I don't know
Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
What did you do with her?
I don't want to talk about it -
I don't know...
then why did you marry her -
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
LESLIE?  Is that good enough?
There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
Don't you want me now LESLIE
It's been what, three years?
What brings the rats out of the sewers?
I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through, because it's only five minutes from my surgery...
Her husband left her
Dead?
I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe.
I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
...A bouncer? Are you serious?
Cut it out, before you break something!
This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.
What is it now?
Oh, how inappropriate is that!
A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.
I thought I loved her.
Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?
We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.
But that smile.
Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?"
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that.
Dad, please.
Sorry I--
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
Very funny.
I didn't forget.
So, William Randolph. Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.
Me-ow.
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
I guess.
Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier.
I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
You're amazing.
I know.
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
That's part of growing up, honey.
You don't have to work another day in your lives.
Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson.
You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.
The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking.
Yes?
I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
People pay good money for that?
Talk to me Artie.
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.
Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?
Then what?
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
You mean he withdrew...
Maybe she used another name.
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.
You could say that.
Where's the body?
Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...
Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...
Are you crazy, Ray?
I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.
The teeth, were they...
Yeah... okay... he did
I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
I said he did.
Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?
I say something funny?
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
Curiosity, I guess.
Get off my property.
Is that Sam Lombardo?
I miss Dad.
Don't forget the car wash.
Say you love me.
Forget it.
Nellie Gail Ranch...
Is that what you think?  You have friends?  Is that what they told you?
Davy.
Sam, for godsake.
And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.
We?
Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
Always hoping.  Or this...
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
All what?
Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
Uh... how long ago was this?
We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake.  I mean...
Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
You're not that big.
Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
Who was this partner of his?
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
You managed alright.
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
Why did you say that?
Sorsha.
Then you get us out of here.
As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
You all right?
Are you a warrior?
Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!
You?
Who?
You?
Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
It's not a Nelwyn baby.
But what am I gonna transform??
How??
Why?
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.
She's hungry.
We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm.
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
Talk!  Say something!
I came to see Rachel Lapp.
It's been a while.
Nail it!
Have you got your gun on now?
Yeah.
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
Who else knows?
Your sister said you don't have a family?
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast.
I can't.
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Two days.
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
Hochmut?
I know what he said.
The... bullets?
Won him over just like that.
I was being foolish?
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
It's me.
You're the first one he'll contact.
You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
No...
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
I have committed no sin.
That is idle talk.
No --
From now on you'll be history
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
... -- Oz -- has spoken!
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
Toto's my dog.
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
How did you guess?
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
That's our farm!
...her face is careworn.
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
Oh, no -- no!
Oh --
...Oh, did that hurt?
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
We might.
Oh, my!
What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.
Yes -- let's run!
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
I'll be home in time for supper!
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
Oh, come on.
As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
Did they hurtcha?
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
Um-hmm.
You're going to see a Wizard?
Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---
You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!
Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
Dorothy next!
Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
Here --   Come on.
Dorothy!
Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
...junk!
Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
Did you hear that?  He'll announce us at once!  I've as good as got my brain!
Oh, did - did you see that?
Oh - upstairs, quickly!
What about us?
-- Ruined my exit!
Couldn’t make it. Splitting headache.
What the hell are you talking about?
Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or we’ll sink.
Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektra’s ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
Who is it?
Consider me ungrateful.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
Who is he?
I don’t want to be safe!
Surely you believe in living dangerously.
How high up does this...arms dealing go?
In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
Someone will come.
Warm.
Why?  What's the problem?
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
Washington?
What's your theory?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
It¹s very strange.  Time¹s flowing backwards . . .
No.  I just wanted you to --
Who?
Adrian -- you've lost it.
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
His . . . whatever.
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
What are you up to?
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
We should get back --  What?
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?
No comment.
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
We're not after car thieves here.
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
What do you have?
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.
"Anarchy" 99"?
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S.
Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
Mind your business.
Where are you going?
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
We can't leave now. We have to do something.
You don't have to do that.
Yorgi and Kirill.
Did you do your homework?
Where'd the damn truck go?!
Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...
Alright, so I'll get more.
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
We all do.
Can the Professor repair his own mind?
I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
Is that so?
The way what is going to be?
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
Oh, shit.
Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  How say you?
They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
No, sir.  It will never happen again.
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
What?
You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
Still happy you married me?
MMmmm.
I promise.
Very....very!
I hope you like large weddings.
Surprised?
Ready, darling?
Are you suggesting I call him master???
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
I don't know what you mean, sir.
But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
What?
All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?
A piece of what?
No, Fred ereck.
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
I want that brain.
Hmm!
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
Yes, Master!
How's it going?
What did you find out?
Is everything ready?
It's alive.  It's -- moving! It's -- breathing!  It's -- standing!  What is your name?
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
And look at this, Doctor!
Me?  Sing?
Not fooling around.
Yes, I have mine.
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
Yes.
They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
Yes?
Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
