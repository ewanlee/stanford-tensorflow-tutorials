Where?
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
You might wanna think about it
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
Can we go now?
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
But you hate Joey
As in...
You did what?
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
It's just you.
Perm?
Daddy, no!
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Never
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
How many people were in your old school?
Who is she?
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
Her favorite uncle
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Then, go get her
What do you think?
You need money to take a girl out
Get her to act like a human
Are you lost?
We don't chat.
My mission in life.
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Hi
I just need to lie down for awhile
Why 're you doing this?
I told you
Just let me sit down.
Who?
But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
Were you in jail?
No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
Look up, sunshine
C'mon.  It's not that bad
I dazzled him with my wit
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
It's just something I had.  You know
As a parent, that's my right
The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
Just for now.
Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
I know.
They tried... but I didn't let them.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
Viceroy of the West Indies.
This time with me!
If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
Call them.
All of them created by people like me.
He understands.
With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
Passion is something one cannot control!
Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
Twenty eight.
You think I don't know that?
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
Where are we going?
Oh, sure.
What's your cut?  How much?
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
I will if they don't send me back.
Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
So you were never a prostitute?
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
Yeah, sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
But Chief?  Over this??
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
Vodka tonic.
It's okay.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
No.
No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
I don't even watch TV.
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
This has nothing to do with your fire.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
So am I.
You know what I'm saying here.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
Can we go up to the crime scene?
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Alright.
Alright?
Alright.
You're ruthless.
Yeah.  I promise.
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.
Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!
We have no money.  Come on.
I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
How you erase this?
Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
Shut up.  Look!
Be quiet.  Watch.
As a plumber?!
We started over, you can too.
In love?  With who?
I want to hear everything he said.
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
Excuse me?
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
What the hell happened?
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
It's possible.
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
That's true.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
Yes, it is.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Yes, Daddy.
Thank you.
Well, how's it going back there?
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
Well, that does sound very odd.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
Certainly.
Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
Roger.
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
I ain't tired yet.
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
Shit.  I'm already sorry.
I may call you worse than that.
I think you better put him on ice, man.
At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
Must be billy's girl.
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
Not likely, convict.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.
No way...
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
Doesn't look like it.
Nothing.
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
I still don't think it's loaded.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
Jack, wait...
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
What do you want?
Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
Sure, right.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
You chickenshit punk...
You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
Not bad, not bad.
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
At your service.
The case was stolen?
No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
I'm fucked!
They are robots!
The girl?
Dallas. Korben Dallas.
It means, "Never without my permission".
What kind of mission?
Of course.
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
I would like to have died in peace...
5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
We will be ready, Lord.
Not without Leeloo.
What is it?
Three of us will never fit in there!
Oh god!
Which one?
All 900.
...Hoppi-hoppa.
You get that off the screen?
No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
I want to sleep... forever...
But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
How's our deal coming along?
Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
Okay, I believe you.
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
You don't understand...
Don't...
I just talked to her.
Sure.
How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
I figured you share information.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
Something like that.
What did you do with her body?
Show me where you buried her.
They're no friends of mine.
Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
Yeah... guess so.
Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
Three, four years.
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
Great.
Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him.  Machine.
Nope.
Thank you.
I'll do whatever I can to help.
He succeeded.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
I don't understand, who are... ?
Neil... Neil Cole.
She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
No.
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
Certainly, sir.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
I know.  Uh...Alice.
"In her dream"?
You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
So?
It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
You had a nasty bump.
It's lonely in there, in my room.
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Very funny.
But Dad --
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
Krueger is reality.
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should.
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
I can't listen to this.
He invited me to his house last night.
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
<u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -
But if they <u>do</u>?
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---
That's wonderful, Carl!  Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull ourself loose!
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit?  Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
I think I should have joined the Air Force!
We can <u>ram</u> him!
Tell me something:  Why can <u>I</u> hear you, when the others couldn't?
I am afraid not.  Therefore -
I'll be another!
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
You don't believe me?
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
Has anybody offered to buy it?
Tell me.
I plan to. Soon.
This spring.
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
Oh.
You can't buy Wade off.
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Hmm.
What happened?
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
Right!
You stayed away?
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
I don't want to.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
Yes.
Yes.
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
It belongs to Pop.
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
Oh.
Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
Don't go playing policeman.
You don't want the extra police pay?
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
Fuck you.
I figured you already heard.
Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
I'm fine, fine.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
You and Mel Gordon?
Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
It's nice.
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
I know your parents.
I don't know for Christ's sake!
Wade.
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
Is...? She's dead then?
Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
How's that?
Hold on!
You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call, and I'm pissed enough to do it now!
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
Jack?
The other guy.
Nothing.
No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did.
Well, it was an accident.
They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
What happened?
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Money.
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
Yeah, no duh.
Don't you even want to ask?
Hey, you guys back already?
It was the experience of a lifetime.
Did we warn them off?
I'm doing what I can.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.
If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage.
Any of us?
Well it worked.
Copy, Air Force One.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
What do you want with us?
My husband is a very courageous man.
No.
Good. Good.
I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
Rose, I don't have time for this.
I miss you. And I miss her.
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
Two... THREE. GO!
who can I say is calling?
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
Thank you for calling the white House...
He and the NRA don't like the wording.
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
That just doesn't make any sense.
Accelerators down.
You better check it, Unger.
Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
Not now, Elaine!
Set!
Compute!
The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
Look, a man can make an honest mistake!! Anyway, she was asking for it!  They're all asking for it all the time!!
Can I hold him?
Sure.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
Just poached on toast.  Over.
Yes.
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse.
That's very nice of you. Thank you.
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
Headquarters!? What is it?
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
Uh-huh.
Every day.
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
No, why don't you take care ot it?
Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
I may be an asshole, but at least I'm a real detective, not some outer shit space thing.
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
That's right.  He and I, along with seven or eight others.  Listen, gentlemen, I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately, at the moment, I'm overdue at another function.
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
Gesundheit.  You don't mind if I stick to George, do you?
A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
And that fits?
I believe I should interview the widow alone.
We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
To the... to the beach?
Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!
Why?
Nothing.
You must leave me alone on this.
We?  You've taken it?
Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.
Do what?!  George-- ?!
We can't let him get away.
You look very good.
For you, anything.
Ss'kya'ta'.
Yeah, I heard of it.
It is. 
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.
Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
How long until it blows?
I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.
You are a head case.  Have a donut.
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
Now, wait a second --
You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
I don't know.
Proceed inside.
Sir?
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
Unknown.  But, it looks like all of them.  Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower.
I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
Just get back here!
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
Just a couple of days.  Do you feel up to a visitor?
And hope to die?
My mommy always said there were no monsters.  No real ones.  But there are.
Why do they tell little kids that?
Did one of those things grow inside her?
Wah...?  Where are...?
Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble.
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
Perhaps.
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
What?
You were sublime.
What did you think of the music?
Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
Why? People fart backwards.
Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
I love you! I love you!
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
I'm not telling you.
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
I can't write it!
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
Originals?
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
But! I'm a married woman!
He needs me, ma'am.
I hope so. I need it immediately.
Leave him alone!
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
Well, this is none of your business.  Whoever sent you is going to pay, no?
Behold!
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
Why not?
Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
And German?
Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Would you tell me why?
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
How is your financial situation?
They say you're in debt.
Oh, let's not talk about it.
Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
Mine?
Why? What has happened?
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
I liked the horse.
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?
Of course not.
I can't say. Really
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
Yes?
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
Who are you?
No, please.
What?
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
Consigned to flames of woe.
What?
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
Yes.
Yes.
Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
You go fast!
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
But, Your Majesty -
Exactly. A dance.
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
What do you want?
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
Then you must know this.
Do you believe it?
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
But not his body.
Yes.
I've seen the manuscript.
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
Ah.
Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
Yes, Doctor?
He said 'Jack'.
What happened to them?
David says Jack comes to warn him.
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
Tea would be nice.
You haven't eaten your lunch.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
Aw come on, Alex!
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
Good. I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room.
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
There is only one bed.
Don't you remember?
Will you shut up!?!!
David, don't lose control.
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
No.
No.
Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
You could have told them!
Alex?
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
Did you see Jack?
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
Right.
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
Okay.
You ask them.
Wrong.
A coyote.
No, but he was on the moors.
Yeah.
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
Will you be quiet?!
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
It's cold, David, and I'm so alone. The undead surround me. Have you ever talked to a corpse? It's boring! I'm lonely! Kill yourself, David, before you kill others.
Jack, are you really dead?
I will not accept this! Now go away!
I want you to meet some people.
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
Why don't we ask him?
Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.
I beg your pardon?
And what, Sergeant?
That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.
You here again? What do you want?
I want to know why .
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
Yes, sir.
Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
Yes! You said it, Clark. That's the only thing that means anything to me.
We've been waiting fifteen minutes—
You know what you can do with that! Come on, take a look at this! You'll see a demonstration of faith that's worth more than all the collateral in the world.
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
Cyril!
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
Happy now?
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
Now don't you worry about it.
All right. Send him in.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Got my letter?
Well, I—
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
He says he can't get away in the daytime.
Yes, sir.
Please, lady. Please be quiet. Everything will be all right.  Open up here, folks. All right, folks, please!
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
Matt, come here!
Come here, honey!
Well, he was making love to her.
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
Mr. Williams . . .
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
Yes, why?
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after—
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
I don't know.
Then where were you?
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men.
Say we bust into a bank. We yell "We're the Younger-James Gang!" People are gonna be thinking, "The younger James Gang? Is there an older James Gang? How come we never heard of the older James gang?" So people are trying to figure that out instead of raising their arms.
I ain't done --
Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
... Will Perry ...
Two.
You are a fine figure of a man.
What is wrong with you?
In case we have to kill these sonofabitches, I don't want them to see us coming.
She was European!
Yeah.
Why aren't we the "Younger-James Gang"? I mean, there's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here.
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
Pass me some whisky.
Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
Well?
I'm thinking...
Get buckets!
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?
Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
Don't care.
And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
No, I --
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
Yeah.
Shush.
Mmmm.
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
What?
Don't swear.
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
I figured.
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
Communion.
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole. Now it's my turn.
You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
This time we'll make an exception.
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
Really?
Don't talk about it much, though.
They had to be dealt with!
They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
Really!
Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
Oh, that's the best part.
So you can't tell me anything?
I can't believe this.
I demand action.
It's going to be a long spring.
In English, Pinkerton.
Pumpkin?
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
Pick me up?
I'm ignoring you.
What do you want, Courtney?
Turn the light on.
Take it off.
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip –  to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
Alright.
Hi. Pat Bateman.
He has a great body
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
But where?
No, you...didn't?
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
What?
See you then.
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
Yes, sir.
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
Detective Donald KIMBALL?
Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
Forget it.
Sorry. 
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
Why would I?
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
Thanks.
Do you feel that way?
Eerie. Really eerie.
Well, I could he wrong.
But Marcus denied it?
Yes.
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
I'm so hungry.
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
It's...it's...all right.
Another Martini, Paul?
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
You are a fanatic.
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it.
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
Milo. Why would he --
...Whaddo I do?
Remember Lyle Barton?
Poor baby. You know that's not true.
He has thousands of employees, Milo --
Look at me! I'm gonna change.
Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
Outpost doesn't own em.
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
...Do I?
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
You're making me young again.
I'm sure.
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
I mean, it's your life.
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
I'm calling Gary.
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
Long story. Not that interesting.
They'd frame him.
Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
What'd he say?
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
Oh.
That's lame, isn't it?
You'll come up with something.
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
Let's try #2.
Wait a second. He knows I know.
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
#21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
Where is he?
Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
We won, Austin.
Thank you, Exposition.
Carnies.
Good on ya, man.
Groovy!
Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
My meat and two veg.
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
Why? What's wrong with my teeth?
No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
I'm sorry.
Of course, luv.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
Do you think she's prettier than I?
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
Don't worry!
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
Here, have a piece of gum.
Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
An evil petting zoo?
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
Did you ever...
I love you, Vanessa.
No, he's really evil.
OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
Red ...
Love...
... power ...
Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Impossible?
If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.
Of course. I planned that, too.
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
The result would be ...
And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
Mother?
Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?
And I suppose you're the knight.
For a man in my position --
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
Any other vices?
Why should they think that?
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
Always.  Except ...
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
I thought you played by the rules.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...
It's called Black Leather.
Shall we?
Pity your mother came, too ...
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
I fail to see --
It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
Oh yes I did. I want you to meet somebody.  I expect you'll like her.
How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
Mother and Father know best.
You wish.
...Really?
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
Women!
Hey, man, congratulations!
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
Ah, Cole.  I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
Thank you, sir.
What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
But a fabulous cook.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
It looks awful.
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
Oh... I got something for that.
You're really pissing me off.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
Yes...
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
You're so romantic...
Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
You know your father enjoys his company.
Well... hope she'll be very happy.
Screw you!
Why?
Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
You're a pimp?
All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest."
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
I couldn't find any razor blades.
It's Bullwinkle.
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
Oh, no!
No sob story is going to change my mind.
In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
Olivier's in that, right?
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
Oooooo.
What's this?
C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business.
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
Right... Think it over.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
He's alive.
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
Hey! You don't know me --
Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.
I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today?  What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
You look great.
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
Huh.
Yeah...
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
I wanted to be a good one.
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
That's a dumb thing to say.
What?
You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
Yeah.
Like it never happened...
Every little boy's fantasy.
Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
What the hell are we waiting for?
Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.
Fixing my roof.
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
And old ladies?
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
Those fucking Mob assholes.
Then c'mere. I got something for you.
"The Strawberries"?
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I --
All right, cop. I want my money.
Are you sure?
There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out.
That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
I'm on it.
Ho!
I'm gonna start a chant and I want y'all to follow me.  Let's make our own 2 real coons know you're ready to start the show.
Delacroix.
Yeah, him.
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
I'm so tired of you running that. I always worked hard for you.  You think I'm a leech, a kling-on, I quit.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
First things first.  I have to know if Manray is up for this.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
And I'm the feet.
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
Forget it.  I believe you're my most creative person I've got on staff.  You're hip.  You know what's happening.  I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me.
It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
Dunwitty, don't leave.
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
I want to speak with you.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
A gift.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
Same thing Giuliani said.
What you did is dead wrong.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
I said no such thing.  All I said is that something must be wrong.
Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
He said that?
Yes he did.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
You sing and dance?
And this is my very best friend Mantan.
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
Not her, the one with the little...
That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.
Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
Never read a book in my whole life.
And?
I wuz leaving anyway, for good.
How do you do, sir?
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
I had thought you more expert.  You must find out if the Chevalier cheats.  He sees the English and Austrian envoys continually, and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house.  Find out what they talk of, for how much each plays, especially if any of them play on parole.  If you are able to, read his private letters, though about those which go to the post, you need not trouble yourself -- we look at them there.  But never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes, and by what channel or messenger.  He sleeps with the keys of his dispatch-box with a string around his neck -- twenty frederics, if you get an impression of the keys.
I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
And so I am.
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
I'll match any man with the sword.
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
The coward!
Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.
Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
Yes, sir.
Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty.
But you refused me, Dorothy.
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
He wants to step into my shoes!  He wants to step into my shoes!
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
Can anybody hear me!
Shut up.  West's dead.
We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
No, actually, I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some.
Yeah --
You saved Kendall's life --
Jesus!
Would you have believed me?
Sir, yes, sir!
We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.
Yeah...
You're the only one missing a grenade.
Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?
Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.
No. Poetic justice, though.
Mr. Hardy?
My heart weeps.
No. I said Dunbar.
I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
Or what? You've gone round the bend --
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
Not for long.
Excuse me?
Is Dunbar cute?
You made me look like an idiot --
You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
Buttfucks the cabin?
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
No death certificates. No crime.
What if I don't want it?
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
To start a fire, goddammit!  What about him, huh? Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack. Y'ever think of that? Go ahead, cut him loose! First chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they work --
What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.
But you didn't see it, right?
We've been making progress, I see.
Childs.
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
No --
Sir, yes, sir!
I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
It truly is.
I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
No.
I suspect it will hurt a lot.
I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
How did you know?
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
I can.
Jesus Christ.
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
Did you do any of that?
You think I'm up for it?
Really.
You're right.
You know where the chemicals are?
It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
Dad?
Can we talk?
What?
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
It would kill you, huh?
Story of my life.
There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
You didn't become crazy.
Yes.
I'll help you.
Mmm, what?
You didn't need to do that. You just didn't.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
Yes.
True. But I've known him my whole life, and I don't feel like I know him at all. Or ever will.
Yes. Thank you.
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
Do you want to stop?
Right.
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.
You must have a visa or something...
Right. Okay. Good.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
They go.
You don't understand anything.
In every sense. If at all possible.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
You are throwing me out.
Laugh it up.
Nobody's that unhappy.
Whatever.
Thanks.
Well. It's good to see you.
That'd be nice.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
Well, that makes it easier.
I'll take a jar of that, too.
You been home yet?
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
I begged him not to go. And he did.
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
Kept us warm for twelve years.
Don't you lay a CURSE ON ME!
Yes. I mean that's it. I wanna feel like a man with her. I wanna feel like the only man with her.
You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
Get this Goddamn thing off me!
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
You can holla y'self hoarse. Ain't gonna bend my will.  Right or wrong, you gonna mind me.  Gonna suffer you like Jesus say, to the FAITHLESS and the PERVERSE GENERATION.
Or what?
Uh-uh.
I can handle that.
You drink whiskey?
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
You think God forgives people like that?  You think God forgives people like me?
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
No, you do it. I can't sing.
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
Meanin' like a team of fellas go to work on her and she don't even break a sweat.  She into football, you know. You got a letter on your jacket you get that pussy in ya lap. I ain't playin'.
I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.
Somethin' wrong with ya phone? Been callin' the last few days.
Or what?
THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT?
She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.
You struck some gold, didn't ya?
All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...
Ronnie...
I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests.  Your money ticket get shipped today?
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.
What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.
I'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater.
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm.
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
Hey, when in Rome --
In Rome, I'll bow.
You said that in the last two places.
Maybe we should bail?
That I should let you pay for the drinks.  Kampai.
Hey, all right.
Where would you look for the mafia?
What's the problem here?
Give us a break...
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
Yeah...
Nick...
There she is!
A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.
I want to go talk to him.
I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
He's on duty.
Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
Save it, I already took the tour.
Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
Can we skip the poetry, inspector?
Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
Twenty-four hours, detective.
Goodbye, officer.
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
Well stocked.
Where?
Oh?
And what can he do for you?
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
He could?
No, you stay here with us.  Out last night together.
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
Industrial refuse.
Garbage man?
I was just about to have my dinner.
Got it.
Okay, here it is.  Eldon Tyrell, his family and half his staff were just massacred.  The cat is about to get out of the bag.  Pressure is definitely on.  The Nexus program is terminated.  When you finish there, locate Nexus designated Rachael and retire.
Your customer, eh?
Oh!  Day after tomorrow.
Okay, but...
Nexus designated Mary:  incept November 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Prosit.
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
Can I come in?
Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.
Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
I don't know nothing about it.
Does it eat?
Why should I be?
Where is he?
Dead.
What?
It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
But then how can you...
Uh-huh.
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
What?
You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
What's up?
Sitting next to you.
Discreetly.
What desert?
I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
We sure did.
Thank-Q!
Your mom was a dancer?
My office.
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
Eve? I'm leaving.
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
Yes, I'm right?
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
You don't?
Nope.
He's all yours. I was holding him back.
And that's it?
Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal. Get in.
Over this?
No.
Doing what?
How long would you need me?
They like Dr. Pepper.
Okay.
Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat.
Then forget it.
What for?
It didn't used to be that way.
The engine is still running.
Never drive again!
Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
Not that one!
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
I'm sorry.
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
Is that what you call it?
Yes, it is.
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.
Merci!
Adult Bookstore.  Why?
Well, in that case...of course, son.
That's what everybody believes?
Who use to own it?
Yeah.
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
Yes. He likes windows.
Almost all of them.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
What?
Of what?
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
Say what?!
I'll be all right.
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
No.
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
Yeah.
I never know anymore.
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
Then after that it's safe.
No.
What?
And I made these!
If he tells, it won't come true!
It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!
--and we will--
Amen.
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve.
Well, that's blunt!
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn minute!
Uh, yes, you do.
You're goddamn right I am!
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
Come on.
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
Stop!
Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Yeah. How's Dad?
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
It's blue. Blue velvet.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Jeffrey nothing.
Shit. You better tell me something.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
Well.
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
I, uh.
Frank? Can you stand up?
I'm alright. Go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Yes.
No. I should go.
Sure I do.
I want you to hurt me.
I asked first.
I'm glad you do.
Dorothy. No!
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
Frank?
Can I feel 'em?
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
Speak to me Fucker.
No thanks. What does that mean?
I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
This is it.
Well. Okay.
Yeah?
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Yeah. okay.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Uh-uh.
Yeah. What are you doing now?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Now, how are you going to do that?
Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
Yeah, but.
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
Okay, okay. Bye.
What did you see?
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?
OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
Who, me? Why should it?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
I'm really sorry.
You want to go talk to him?
Shoot.
Yeah.
Where to?
You look beautiful.
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me.
Okay.
Stop it Mike.
Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
I mean it now. I carried the two of you little bastards around in my belly at the same time you ungrateful pissants. Ya ruined my girlish figure in one fell swoop, and then ya sucked me dry.  My tits are saggin' down ta my ankles. I trip over em for Christ sakes, now ya listen ta me, NO FIGHTEN!
I can't find the second one, sir.
Any word back from the E.R.s?
You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
Let's do him right here.
Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!
MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
We're here brother.
You gotta keep going.
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
We paid attention in school.
Be careful.
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
He got beat up by a girl.
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
What?
I'm serious.
All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Yes, we are.
So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
Okay then... let's get ya started.
Uh... two shooters!
They were wearing masks.
How do you figure?
You killed my... my...
These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
What?
Eight.
Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does.
We promise.
So you're not just talkin' mob guys. You're talkin' anyone, right? Even like pimps and drug dealers and all that shit?
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
Fuck you!
You believe?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
Have you no fear of God?
God have mercy on my soul.
Gimme the fuckin' thing. Now sit the fuck down!
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
That's not what I meant, Dignan.
I'm lookout.
You're right. You're right.
Where's the other stocker?
Yes, they are.
What about them?
On your marks...  Get set go.
Hi.
As long as he gets out OK.
Obviously. That's a given.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
Where was I?
She doesn't need to know.
I'm not. But there's --
Our money situation is not good.
Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
Yes. I do.
Go ahead, Bird Dog.
Take your second position.
Applejack! What's happening?
You got to be kidding me.
Pretty much everything.
We're not sure.
No. I'm not.
Hold it.
Exactly. Woah.
Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me.
Who?
There's a million places to hide around here.
Nobody does.
You think I'm improving?
Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you prefer Cuba or the United States?
You're Anthony?
The front stairs.
That's your friend Anthony?
What's he doing here?
We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
True.
No.
It's true, Dignan.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
So it's my fault?
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
Good luck, since I got the keys.
All right! Backyard! Right now!
Let's go!
I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
Here we go.
Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting.
Hand to hand combat?
Did you hear that?
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
Oh, yeah.
Where?
Right.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
I want to know what happened.
And Bourne? Where's he now?
We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
Don't you want answers?
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
Had to be done.
I killed them.
I don't know.
How long? How long do I have -- 
I'll get the book.
One day it will be different. It just takes time.  We'll make new memories. You and me.
So...
It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
We can't wait to be sure.
It might have.
Yes.
I killed him???
What do you mean?
I was here!
Ramstein Air Base, Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.
Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?
Some women like Dobermans --
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
So?
Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
I don't want to leave.
We must sue for peace.
Peace?!
We cannot defeat this --
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him, he will not survive the winter. It is very cold -- is it not, our flower?
You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
You mock us with a smile?
Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush.
Hamish, I... thank...
Aye.
That's just a dream, William!
I should'a remembered the eggs.
A common thief.
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
I do not confess.
No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
I will be with you, like this. Forever.
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
Who would do such a thing?
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
You know the answer to that.
But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
Can you protect me?
I see a car.
Photos?
Shhh! I need quiet for this.
What?
I'm sorry.
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
He must be. They're letting him go, right?
I've stopped a hundred times.
Of course.
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy.
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
Why's that?
Because you're... different.
Different? How?
Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
Oh? There's proof now?
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
Stop! Take me back!
I was?
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
We'll find out soon enough.
Me neither.
I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
Deal. Now read me something.
I think I'll go check out the chapel.
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
Yes, Monsieur.
You want my advice?
-- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
Yes, Monsieur.
A champagne cocktail, please.
How long can I afford to stay closed?
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
What do you want for Sam?
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
And the carrying charges?
Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
What are they?
Why there is no other man in my life?
All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
I don't know the finish yet.
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
You can believe that if you want to.
Please.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
No.
Why weren't you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
I don't understand. What about you?
I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
And I said I would never leave you.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Rick? Who's he?
Thank you. I try.
Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
I said, ask your wife.
My wife?
Had a close one, eh?
Yes, rather.
Here it is.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.
Thank you.
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Unofficially, of course.
When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.
This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less.
Perhaps not.
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
I have my orders.
Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
Well, it looks like you're a little late.
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
Uh huh.
Don't listen to him, Sacha. Fill it up.
There seems to be no secret about that.
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
Rick, hide me. Do something! You must help me, Rick. Do something!
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
Do too much, I'll die.
Take it.
Yeah, sure, what?
I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly.
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
You are.
Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
Well, I do a little drawing --
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
Sure.
Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
You can't go now.
I burned the Christmas tree.
Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
Hey...hey...it's okay!
Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
My epitaph.
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
I'm so glad you're alive.
Anything else?
There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney.
Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
But all that's behind me.  I'm fine now.
Sure.
Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.
There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
I'm touched.
That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am.
I braided them.
Forty-three days.
I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing.
To Wilson.
What's it all about?  It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about.
Deep, real deep.
No sweat.
Some new *things* would be useful. I don't need any "new help."
You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples?
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
Really?
Where's Mandalay?
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
Nothing.
*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
Rose, I know what's going on. Homer told me. I got pregnant, too--about a year ago.  I've been through this.
Yes, I *have*!
I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
Well, they aren't.
I know what you've been doing.
Nobody ever wants me!
You mean somebody asked?
Did you know your mother better?
His father's dead, right?
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
You still doin' it too fast!
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
Obviously.
If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.
When *doesn't* he have bronchitis? I wouldn't call his bronchial infections "underdeveloped." Would you?
We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. 
What you got a picture of your heart for?
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
Everything looks in order.
Gee... What makes you say that?
That's not a bad place to start.
It's all about the money, isn't it?
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
Yes it is, Jake! Yes it is! They were right there for you. She was right there for you! Look at her!
People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.
I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody mess up the hoop?
Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
We pay better.
She's up for it.
Eight A.M. flight.
Calls?
What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
I have a good crew.
You ask a lot of questions. Come on.  Let me see 'em.
Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
Help me.
Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
You're just going to have to trust me.
Uh-huh.
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
Don't ruin this for me.
You guys got busted. This is a great neck.
No, I want my cut!
Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
I'm getting clear of this. If you're not going to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money. Gordo?
But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
That was fucking deep.
No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-
It's not history.
So what do you want?
Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature.
I've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now. Problem is, the guy's the invisible man. A spook, a spectre, a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's good buddy and member of his crew, Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head.
High five.
All right. As what?
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
I'll try and make it.
It's nothing to do with money. I don't gamble.
Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
Not particularly.
And your lady?
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
How did you land that?
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
Never. Why do you ask?
Really?
There was a message, wasn't there?
Then what?
I want to buy a car.
Found a job?
All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.
You know where I'm from?
Do you believe in astrology?
Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology.
Absolutely not.
I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
Who's they?
What about my neck?
No, forget it. The bet's off.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
Yes.
I took the bandage off yesterday.
It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
Did you solve your problems?
Ross.
No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.
You're talking about complicity.
"The world breaks everyone, and afterwards many are strong in the broken places." Ernest Hemingway.
Don't worry.
Cheers. Happy New Year. I really like you, Jacko, you're so fucking straight.  Hey, you haven't changed your clothes!
It was you, you shit.
No.
I was at Beadles.
It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
Wipe your hands.
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
How?
We have tapes in here that go back six months. Let me show you something.
Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
I can see.
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
Bruised.
Take your time. Two weeks. Three if you need it. We'll pay you sick leave. I don't want to lose you. You're a good man. Here...
I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
Time to start talking.
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
So don't give me any of that sentient life crap. Find me something I can blow up.
Talby, can you read me?
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
Check at six minutes.
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
Bomb?
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
That's it.
Of course not.
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
Doolittle...
Yes.
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Fred.
-- automatic channels open --
-- Remark.
Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?
You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
I wish I had my board with me now. Even if I could only polish it once in awhile.
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
Yes sir. Negative effect.
Well, what you might try is --
Yeah.
Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is.
I like to keep it professional, that's all.
He's got exposure.  He sees you starin' at fifteen to life, there's a chance you could roll over, cop a plea, who knows? Man's figured the odds...and he can't take a chance.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
What?  Where're we going?
So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
A grand.
I got overhead...
Yeah, me too.
Yech...
Look, I'd really like to...
Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.
No...
First time I ever heard that.
I was expecting someone else.
We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
Something.
Bent.
You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.
The other one like you...
I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
You are involved.  By being alive you're involved.
Ladies would be elsewhere.
But she does work here?
What do you want?
Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
I understand.
I'm you, I take that money and get outta town while you can.
You and me both.
Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight...
Shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
I have sincere eyes.
Okay...idea.  Compromise, right?  Bruno here comes with me.  He holds the money until mommy shows up, then we close escrow.  What you do with her after I'm gone doesn't keep me awake nights.
Probably a touch of what's going around.
I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
You can tell 'em yourself tomorrow.
Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
Really?
And you were a sympathetic ear.
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
I'm a toy to her.
What happens if you level with her?
Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
He's sick.
Pick a song, Hawk.
It's okay.
You don't know how long I've been waiting to hear that... Jam!
Right, slow...
That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?
What? That's disgusting!
For once Lex is right. It's over. Things can't get any worse from here.
Brilliance, Trip. Sheer brilliance. Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize.
Check!
Damn straight we are.
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
It's my Bullworker.
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now!
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
We all beat each other up, then, once we're nice and bruised, we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen. They gotta let us in then.
It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
What else can I do? Oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah, do you realize what this means? That you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces! Now you want to see the devil in the flesh. You want to reach out and touch pure evil... and in Detroit no less!
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." We're going this time and that's all there is to it.
Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
Look, I want to live, but I don't know where the fuck I'm gonna find two hundred bucks.
Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, that's it!
Did you know him?
Like a spear.
I'm telling Mom.
Donnie! Give it back!
What did you say?
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
School's cancelled.
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
That was a compliment.
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
My mom is gone.
Where is she?
It's safe here.
No. Frank.
When did you stop taking your medication?
Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.
Grandma Death.
His name is Frank.
No.  That's stupid.
What is her name?
I asked you about school.
Four times... so far.
What did you find?
The good stuff.
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
That I did it again.
I have the power to build a time machine.
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
No I don't.  She worries about you.
Okay, but it has to be a small one.
Everything is going to be just fine.
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
You can suck a fuck.
Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
Kitty...
Go back to China, bitch!
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
Oh-yah.
My mom wanted me to have this?
Really?
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
Airport Ho-Jo!
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
I can't believe this is happenin'. I can't believe she said you couldn't...
Huh?
We all do. Now let's go.
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
And the bite marks on my ears?
Bye.
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
You don't know where this is gonna...
Okay. Take her purse.
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
Mm-hm.
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
Y'betcha, Iris. We still need a third judge and we need to think of a theme.
I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
And everything.  He should be king!
Take a letter.
"My dear"...
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
I'll have to enclose the check first.
They'll know I mean business then they get that letter...  see that that gets out immediately and that goes for you too.
I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
I don't want him.
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
That's not bad for any day.
I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something...
Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers every morning.
Sure.
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
And Vera niece, too.
You worm!
I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
Nothing doing!!  I've taken a lease on the battlefield.  I'd lose my deposit, besides, I've already ordered the ammunition...
Was it -- swine?
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
Now -- er --
Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
It is every woman's problem.  Who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands?  Who...
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
Like this. 
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me, Frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. Good day.
Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm?
I feel much better. Thank you.
Are you comfortable here?
Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
Oh no?
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
You're English.
Hello...
Say "Mmmerrick."
Hello, my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you!
You did not ask me.
I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
Then I shouldn't change anything?
Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
Yes! The workhouse!
Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
You're right, Mothershead, please forgive me... Of course, I appreciate everything you've done for John, and I'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. But, I'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think best. I'm also very late, so please forgive me.
A dressing bag?
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
Pardon me?
Ah! It's my father!
Open up! I know you're in there!
Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
But you LOVED her all the same...
Five this week; how many the week before?
Why?
I'll bring it back.
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
The second note to wake the Gods...
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
REALLY?
YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
Why?
He wants to kill US!
The important thing is not to panic.
Yes.
I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
Well you started it.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Why... should YOU care?
Find it... AND cross it!
It saved my father!
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
She got me thinking...
That's my boy!
You may need a real Berserk.
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
So?
But you're the Gods!
You'll be sucked down too!
Oh... right!  Well... CHEERS everybody!
Keitel Blacksmith?
I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.
Let me do something for myself for a change!
I have to go...
Please.
He hasn't.
Same thing, isn't it?
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
Look! I don't feel BAD about it. I just feel ILL.
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
Well... I... I thought...
No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you!
Neither am I.
I'm not frightened... of anything...
Tell him I'm coming!
Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
Yeah.
I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
It's okay, really.
Rockville Center.
Really? Because --
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
I'm sure you would.
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
Huckleberry Hound?
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
I don't want to take you out of your way.
I don't know.
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
Yeah? Oh, great!
Yes.
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
I want to know you.
Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.
Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
What was I wearing?
Egad, were you horrified?
But you weren't. I could tell.
I was so nervous. I remember I couldn't think of anything to say. There were long silences.
Come up and see me... now.
It's very late.
Okay.
Probably.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
Okay.
What are you doing?
What if you stay this time?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
Joel, come here. Please.
Hey, Joel --
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
I don't know. Panties and --
I'm like a joke to them.
The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.
And what are you like? A wino?
I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
What? What do you mean?
It's not somebody else.
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
Hi, Mary. How's it going?
Very cool. Trippy.
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
You found us okay?
Hi.
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Is that Nietzsche?
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
Just wanted to let you know.
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
Clockworks.
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clichés and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
Well.... er...
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
Yep.
I am once more about to make advertising history. And only you, the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could possibly assist me.
Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
Don't start with me, Cooper.
I'll get him.
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
You're okay now, it's over...
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
He's crashing...
His peritoneum has ruptured...
I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?
It's the Event Horizon. She's come back.
A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them.
The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four.
Start the countdown.
Justin. I won't let you die.
Alive?
Justin.
Thanks.
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
That's what we're here to find out.
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
You can't, your orders are specific...
Then who the fuck are you?
Starck... Cooper...
One-four degrees...
That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.
Now what?
Alright. Prep the Clark for launch. I'll find her.
What is it, Smith?
Then what are you doing here? Come on, people, let's go!  And Cooper... Put some pants on.
Radiation interference?
So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
No. It was someone else.
Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
I've seen bodies before. This is different.
Not according to the computer.
Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
Claire is your wife?
It means nothing.
Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
Victor did.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
About me? How sweet.
To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.
I'm sure he's matured since then.
I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
'Course not. Strictly business.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Reed?... Sue?
Stay right. Left is trouble.
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
I think that thing is Ben.
Blockhead started it!
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
That's good. That's uh... good.
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
Excuse me?
What in the world would give me that idea?
You need a doctor.
The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
Arnold. What's happening?
Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor.
I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.
Yes. I think so. Show some pride, Hamilton.
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
Manager!!
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
They were left over from the last shift.
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
Mark is a really nice boy...
I know what I look like.
Well...
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
Ace the jacket.
All right. Pay attention.
You wuss. It's no problem. One person says something to the other and that's how it starts...
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
I'm Carrie Frazier from Toys 'R Us. Judy Hinton from May Company told me I could ask you something.
I thought he was out of town.
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Hey! That's my line!
Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.
He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.
I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
I don't know... I just don't feel right.
But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too.
You're right. I didn't tell you that.
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here.
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
All right! Oh, yeah!
No problem.
Thanks. So do you.
Yes... I am really nineteen.
We keep them, in case the people come back.
I've heard that, too.
Not at all.
No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
Naw. I don't mind.
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.
They're everywhere. Nobody's safe. And sure as hell not in the South. They like warm weather... You'd never believe it. In L.A. it's out of control. First it was drugs, now it's witchcraft.
Naw!
It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
Damn right!
But what about our room? And the golf shoes?
What do you expect? I'm your attorney. You owe me five bucks. I want it now.
Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk. 
He told me he was turning in early...
They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.
Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
You're supposed to be in Vegas. We have a suite at the Flamingo. I was just about to leave for the airport.
Well... It'll probably work out. We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
No, she's looking for you.
Relax. Let me handle this.  You'd make a piss-poor lawyer... Room 1600, please.  As your attorney, I advise you not to worry.  Take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit.
You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome.
Nobody. I'm the maid!
Of course, officer.
Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
Where is everyone?
Nah, I got the gun.
Anyone.
Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
We're lucky to be alive.
Where's that?
And the rest of 'em?
Fuck you too.
The door... on three.
What?
Just cover me. It was built to move.
But --
I can't feel a thing, Hon.
You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
What?
What do you mean what?
Open?
Nine?
Duh hickey.
Wait God-dammit!
I just hit it like you said.
Who's this?
Thank you --
But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!
Come here. I want to show you something.
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
Where's Clifford?
What does Clifford say?
Who?
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
You want his name?
Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
Is Kaminski a Communist?
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
And you think it's worth all this?
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
They'll just catch you again, Francie. Besides, your mother will know.
When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer?
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought.
Address?
Then don't go to Hollywood.
Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
Don't touch me.
I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk.
Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
Harry.
You think I'd miss it?
I just wanted to see how you looked.
What?
Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny dipping.  For starters.
Eight stories.
Yeah.
Is that why you did it?
Forget it.
The hell you will, Harry York.
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
Calm down, Frances.
That's right.
Huh?
Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
Huh?
What's that?
Will you marry me?
I got your number, Mister Man.
Who?
I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.
That would be okay.
Did you expect him to look you up?
That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
You are a deeply troubled young lady... I only hope you change your course before it's too late.
What?
Mama, what's...
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
It's your fan mail, little sister.
Thanks are hardly necessary.
Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
Stay calm, please.
You're telling me you feel guilty.
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
'Incurable.'
And he drove me to mine.
It can't be as bad as that.
More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
Materials. Nothing more.
I don't know.
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
A brain. Extremities.
So have I
I should go. I should leave today.
It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
I wish to be your husband.
I'm all right. I'm safe,
Why the change? What about your work?
Aye, Captain.
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
I know. You have a way of making an impression.
Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak.
...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
That's blasphemy!
I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
How is it you come to be here?
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
You know of it?
Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.
Tomorrow is another day.
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything.  I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain. We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife.
I had to.
I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
I love you.
Don't call him.
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
You? The brick?
Lead the way!
Umhummmmph.
There you are dead wrong.
Girls can't be cowboys.
That's thirty percent.
Yeah, follow us.
I'm exhausted.
Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us into Mexico.
On the dresser.
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
Yes.
Didn't like it, did ya?
No, I didn't.
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
I can handle Richie, don't worry.
Forever together.
Ain't it the truth.
Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.
Scott?
Not good enough, swear to God.
Well, when you run out of weapons, just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em sing for their supper.
I would say that's a very safe assumption.
You callin' him a liar?
He signaled the Ranger.
Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face.  And I saw him mouth:
One... Two... Three.
That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.
What'd ya see?
Cops.
Is it me? Is it my fault?
It's not your fault, it's her fault!
What?
Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
Or what?
I don't know, you just passed out.
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
You know what you look like?
No, Richie, what do I look like?
My shit is together.
It don't look together.
Who's "we"?
Who's...  Lieuten --
What'd you find, Kathy?
Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
Really, I have no problem with --
It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
I think you've resented me from the start, sir.
West?
Smoke her.
High-school pentathlete... ROTC scholarship, graduated with honors... top marks in Basic Training... and, as it just so happens, a constituent of my home state of Virginia.  Oh, the things I'll do for one extra vote.
In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
I'm sure it is.
I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men.
No, ma'am.
Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
Do that.
'Snot me.  It's him.
Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
I can make this wall without --
Get it up!
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts.  But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone.
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
Just like you would be.
Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.
This has nothing to do with you.
I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
Me?  Why me?
I can't walk two blocks in Washington without hearing about "G.I. Jane."  You're all over the place, and whether you wanted it or not, the feminists are sizing you up for that poster.
Yeah.  Me too.
Wick.  They got your crew, too?
I think you look beautiful.
What, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist?  How dumb you gotta be? That's exactly what they --
Educate her, Pyro.
You were commissioned one month earlier, which makes you the senior officer.  Remember.  There are no bad crews -- only bad leaders.
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
Sure.  Just like your men do.
Show us where you are, Chief.
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
So am I.
This ain't even workin' wrong!
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
You made a mistake.
What?
You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.
Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
What else do you know about it?
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?
Oh, just some insurance guy.
Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.
What do I get?
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey?
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
Oh, I'm not married.
I don't think so.
I'll try.
Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!
And how should we do that, Sir?
Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
Yes. This testing done by my country left a terrible mess. We are here to clean it up.
Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
How do I do that?
555-7600. Tell them it's a code dragonfly. They should get you through.
...Yes sir.  Your quarters sir.
You go first! There's no time!
I played Richard III...
No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't.  I can't!
Dear God.... How did I come to this?
Nobody was WATCHING?
What?
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
Wait two seconds then go.
Shit! Go!

What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.
I don't like this... I don't like this at all...
The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
Do I? DO I?  For all you know I'm just "CREWMAN #6"!  Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?
We're doing episode 31?
Whatever, the one with the hologram. The wall of fire.

TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
What are you doing? What are thev doino? ~7C INT. SARRIS' SHIP	h37C
This is embarrassing, really.   I shan't tell this story when I return home.
Our former Commander was not... Strong.
Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
We have become aware of these concepts only recently. In our dealings with Sarris. Often Sarris will say one thing, and do another. Promise us mercy and deliver destruction... It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost.  But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris.
But... Inside, I have seen-
Anything.
Okay, let's go.
It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
Mark 20 Into the black hole,  areao.
You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
It is.
The army can survive without me.
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
Same old story.
You go too far, Benedict.
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
Well... I misunderstood, then.
A lot of years have gone by.
Yes, my lord.
Many of them, many did not possess proper arms.  My lord.
More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
Marquis!  Get these men reformed, send Steuben and Wayne out on the left...
No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.
I am not conscious of it, sir!  But since you have thought it necessary to tell me so, we part!
Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions.
Well, if it's my last order, then I order them to be there!  Tell them I will give them my decision then.
Detained by what?
George!  So good to be back!
They help me understand why we fight.
Joseph, are you afraid to cross that river with me?  I accept your resignation.  With regret.  You have leave to return to Philadelphia...
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  I am serving without salary.
I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
I think I heard that.
What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
I'm honored, but, reluctant to leave you.
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
Or, 'civilized'.
That's good... who?
Yes!
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
So where's the money?
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
Come here, Farrah...
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
You're right.
So you didn't have the key with you.
You spotted them, huh?
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
A zillion, huh? That's a lot.
That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
Boy, this town. Word gets around, doesn't it?
All I want in return is to work on the movie with you. Fact I already got some ideas on how to fix it up.
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
The three hundred grand a guy named Leo Devoe scammed off an airline. The three hundred grand Chili Palmer now has in his possession.
'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.
I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.
Something shouldn't be there.
Leo spanked a waitress?
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
I know what a marker is.
They don't want to deposit yours and have it bounce. That annoys them. So your dear friend Dick Allen's been calling, leaving messages on your machine, but you never get back to him. I happen to be in Vegas on another matter, and Dick asks me as a favor would I look you up. I follow you over here, see you in the window with this woman, looks a lot like that actress Karen Flores, was in Grotesque, except she's not blond anymore...
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
Heart attack. Apparently they brought a couple hookers along.
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
You're kidding, right?
Never say anything unless you have to.
Hey, Harry.
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
Exactly. You either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket, I don't give a fuck. You don't ever hand me a book with a miss in it.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
I'm looking at you.
Now you're squinting like you need glasses.
You're not going to tell me the rest?
How'd you know I was here?
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
I know what a vig is.
Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
Not yet.
Definitely not Martin. Movie stars never pick up the check. They have no idea what things cost. Most of them don't know their zip code and a lot don't even know their own phone number.
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
Hey, Chili? Look at me.
What's Momo gonna want with an old place, shows old movies people don't care about no more. Outside of maybe turnin' it into a porno house, I don't think he's gonna give much of a fuck. And you already got a job.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
He already knew it.
Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now...  She's gonna talk to Martin?
Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
Murray's dead.
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
I don't have a dog.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
Morning, skipper.
I don't know. Tuesday?
What?
I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.
Seen a lota movies.
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?
I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.
Yeah, yeah.
It's a risk I'm willing to take.
The right way and the wrong way.
Then it happened before they scuttled her.
How about you Epps?
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
I think you better see this for yourself.
With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
I didn't touch the fucking radio.
Then you're a lucky man.
Sorry.
Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
What guy?
Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
What happened.
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
Epps, over.
Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
What?
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
How's that?
You're up late.
Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. Where's Epps?
And look what happened.
Lost my sea legs.
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
Leave it.
Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
Better late than never.
Give up?
Are you still looking for a job?
Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them.
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
Oh I love to cook. I guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but I believe you should trust your instincts. When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... I don't know... harmless. Ready for ice cream?
Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh...
I see... interesting...
And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
Uh-oh.
You can count on me, sir!
Okay, okay... I won't say a word...
I'm afraid I don't understand. I simply wish to know --
Oh my God, that's HIM!
Hi.
What do you mean "why"?
That's just the way I am!
How long have you been up?
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
There's my dad with Joanie.
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
Totally! Look!
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
It's always closed...
Let's go hassle Josh.
As always.
JOSH!
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
What? Where?!
Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
Do you still want to do something tonight?
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
It just came yesterday...
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
I love this place... it's so - you know, "funky."
I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.
Where did you get those pants?
...are you waiting for a bus?
You're late, asshole.
I did too!
Later, "Dude".
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
Indian records?
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
Let's just say "music" - that way you only use up one...  Wait, we have to go in here for a second...
Oh my god! We have to go in here!
We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
I promise I'll take good care of it.
Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
Well, uh... I'm an expert-about stuff like this -- she was totally for real!
Hi, it's me...
Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...
Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time...
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
Just someone so young...
I... I don't think so.
Does that mean you don't like me?
No, of course not.
I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
What?
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
What do you want?
Still torturing yourself over that Enid, huh?
Yeah.
Why would she be hiding from me?
I don't know... where is she, then?
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
Did she say that?
On that pathetic fake blind date.
So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
There is no reason for fear.
On that I choose to remain dubious.  Two are dead now in two nights. 
-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
-now you're telling me my beliefs?- I don't think so-
We'll have to make them come to us, won't we? And since there are two of them, we're going to set two plans in motion.  First: we must move the entire hospital by tomorrow night.
How could it be? I hate Africa.
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here.  But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now.
I assure you we came close many times-
And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up.
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
That's very considerate.
No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
I can try.
Has it ever done that before?
What happened to them?
I got big. 
Don't they have to be?...
Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  Take the others to the water tower for the night.
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?
This is more difficult-
Thank you, Samuel.
Good news?
Oh yes. But it takes time.
Since his beard was red.
I don't believe you had a mother. 
No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
I'd rather not.
Does he ever mention me?
No.  Not that I can recall.
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
Thank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this eventually.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
There's no doubt about it.  He's got his father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  And smelly.  You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled.  What's his name?
Good-bye, Peter.
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
Oh, sure, that sounds great.
So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.
-- the sorrow --
You were the one who got me in.
Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
Well, for your sake, I hope you're right.  But I think my other guest may disagree with you. Elaine, you had another date in mind?
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.
They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.
From where -- Neptune?
Good idea.
Do it!  Just do it!
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:
You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
I hate Jello.
Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow.
It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
What?  Yeah.
No, I just thought --
You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
If she's naked under that toga.  She's French, you know.
No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I'm not ready to do that.
That's a violin concerto.
He is the Destructor.
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
What is it?
Has this ever happened before?
I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
A square?
What on earth gave you that idea?
What?
Full-stream with strogon pulse.
God, it's ugly!
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
What do I say?
For what purpose?
Where are you, Pete?
I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me.
Do you believe in God?
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
What do you mean "choose?"  We don't understand.
And Caesar!  Let's not forget to serve Caesar!
If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
You're coming back?
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
You flatter me, Caesar.
Quintus will tell the army that you are being called to Rome to celebrate your victory.  They will hear that you are living in luxury. He will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life. And soon the army won't even remember your name.
Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.
He must have been.  He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?
Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.
Why you?
I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
Let's hope he doesn't start giving orders.
It's my job to keep my job.  And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good ole Tribuus has been retired.
The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
What you don't want to imagine is the things I've done.
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome.
Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.
Was I?
Hello.
No.
This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
No.
Yes.
Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
-- really incredible --
All right then! Yes!
Did you say rape her?
What did she say?
I don't feel well.
No.
When?
Yes.
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
Why wouldn't it?
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
Oh no. He said that.
Yes I am.
Yes, I will.
Because I don't like you.
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
Where are you?
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
Will you sign the register, please?
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
Whatever you say, sir.
Let's go.
Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
What do you drink?
What?
Won't you unzip my dress?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
Because I find you very attractive and any time --
Do you want me to get it?
Well -- I don't know.
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Why don't you watch?
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
Who said it was my first time?
Don't you?
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
What?
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
Now let's keep going here.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
We don't.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
Is it?
Is it?
Are you shocked?
All right. Now let's get to bed.
So old Elaine Robinson got started in a Ford.
Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?
Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
You're not.
You're goddamn right I am.
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
Of course I wouldn't.
If that's how you feel --
Very good, sir.
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
What?
I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
Goodnight, Benjamin.
You believe me, don't you?
I do.
-- then I'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on Thursday.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson that you're just too busy every evening -- doing God knows what --
What?
Ben -- how old are you now?
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
Need any help?
I don't like your tone.
With the pearls --
Not with strangers.
Have you seen it?
Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Money -- Ever heard of it?
Chasing what?
Would you like to make a man happy?
What do you want here?
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
What is the matter?
I know.
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
Yes.
Shall I see you again?
On the train?
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
I did not ask your advice.
No -- letters to two-eighty.
Oh -- but -- I --
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
Preysing?
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
What?
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
Tired?
Yes, I photograph very well. Look --
What?
I understand you perfectly.
No -- now.
I understand perfectly.
Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
A thousand marks -- 
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Exactly.
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
All right.
Mop rags --!
All you have to do is phone for it.
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
What?
Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen. 
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet.
I'm cancelling the engagement.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
You'll be very much alone, my dear madame. This is the end. 
There was -- there was.
Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
Go away -- go away.
Yes, the police must be called.
When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.
Well -- gentlemen.
I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
And if you do it wrong?
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
You know who I work for.
Hello.
That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.
No?
I guess I owe you my life.
Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be.
I've really got to --
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
No, I guess not. It was pretty lousy of me, I guess, to be a child at the same time you were. Not to stop being a child just because I had a child. I guess I was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up.
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
A future. The only future I've got.
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
Joe, you know you'll --
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
What?
Nobody does that single-o.
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
What?  What for?
Open it and find out.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
That's what I say.
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
Well, let's get the shock over with.
No, its -- Why did she--?
It's for your cigarette.  I prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
Girl scouts.
Care to join me?
It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
My god...
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
Checking out your place.
No.  Wait for the police.
Betcha' didn't predict that.
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
Just forget it...
No.
Why didn't you tell me?
I came to see you.
I can see that.  Why?
Here, take my jacket.
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
Who?!
You okay?  You seem a little off.
Are you going to leave, too?
Do we have to invite him to the wedding?
You say, "The key to my heart," and I'm gonna hurl.
Very insightful.
Is Tim there?
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
Danny, you're just going to have to wait!
Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.
No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
Not just Kyle.  All of you.  His entire family.  Here.  Look at this.
It's a rune ... Thorn.
He's gone.
That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.
After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live. You have to.
An old friend.
This is madness, Wynn.
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael Myers come home?
I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
No one.
It's a bitch.
I'm gonna wet my pants.
Oh, shit.
At least we found the diamonds.
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
The hell with the diamonds!
How short the skirts are.
Let's talk about something else.
The educational process.
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
Every time I start thinking like that I get the clap.
You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
What's this?
In what way, pray tell?
You never played a violin.
I know you think that.
They were enemies.  We were at war.
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
You actually sold insurance!
I've considered that.
Things.  Oh--you silly people and your things.  Things, things, things.
Gee whiz--
I wouldn't drop my gun.
You're my buddy.
Are you--
Life has denied me that thrill.
They were in the same creative writing class.
College?
What's good about that?
Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.
Where did you get the poison?
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
They're not engaged.
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
I can't take my eyes off you.
She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
The smallest thing I've got.
Nothing.
Sir?
Disease?
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
We all do.  But now it's body time. Relax.  Ideally, the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream. You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods.  Think of your muscles one by one.  Let them go slack.  Relax.  Let the brain go blank.  Relax.  That's the idea-- that's my girl.  Now the small of the back.  Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl.
You're wrong.
Then let me see him go out and get some exercise.  Right now!
You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
And what is his most cherished possession?
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
Did you like it, dear?
Unless she has nerve.
I see.
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
What a handsome word.
Stop!
There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.
I mean it!
Do it, Norbert.
She's crying because she's so happy.
I was going to ask.
Are you've seen it work cures?
Everything about you is the editorial we.  Take that away from you, and you'd disappear.
You were wrong, you quack!
Yes.
Correct.
You haven't heard me yet.
Now who's being cruel?
We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns.
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language.
Alice is dead?
I heard you were looking for me.
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
What a relief!
I'll kill myself.
All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
He's a ghost!
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
I don't really know.
It's beautiful.
What difference does that make?  Is Dr. Woodly going to be my father now?
Then who flushed the toilet?
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
Then get him.
You're taking Mom out tonight?
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
Don't worry about it.
If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt.
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
Yeah.
How nice.
Marry me instead.
That's the XKE.
If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.
I believe in miracles now.
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
Not true.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines.
I feel like I've been double- crossed.  If you'd just told me it was Harold's birthday--
Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  I'm going to bring that boy back.
We can take off the "Wanda June" with a butter knife.
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.
What are you doing?
I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
I just want to ask some questions.
What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
Yeah.
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
Well, next time you talk to him, tell him to pay his actresses more.
Nah.
You're not a film producer, are you?
How much do you make a week, Niki?
I don't drink, but you can go out.
No.
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
You don't understand shit.
They were here?
Shit.
More or less.
You really believe all that?
But what?
What makes you so sure?
Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.
Where is she?
No.
They're legal now.
Do the police want to arrest me?
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
What you got in mind?
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
Well...
It's fifty cents admission. It's applicable to a purchase.
But I...
I don't know nothing, man.
To anybody.
Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
Oh, I don't have one.
Isn't this your vehicle?
Took it?
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
Check.
Lady! Be quiet.
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...
I don't know.
I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon.
Nice to meet you.
Well then, I must be off.  We shall have to meet again.
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
Sort of.
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the "Rape of Rome" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan.
Is he all right?
Oh, it's all right. It's organic.
Yes. It's almost there.
Well, I really don't smoke.
Did Confucius say that?
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Come on, you loved it. It was a new experience.
Oh, Harold. You are so young.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
Farewell?
But why now?
Can't complain.
Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
No.
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
I go to funerals.
You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
What would you say?
What kind of stuff?
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
Oh sure.
Eh?
How about to slit his throat?
She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
Shit. Bull. Shit.
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
She certainly has.
It's coming.
You a doctor, too?
The boxes! I TOLD you.
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
WHY?
It's been Hell.
And what about you?
I'm lucky that way.
Air and sea backup. What's closest?
No. It's not.
Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
Okay. You saw the fish man, right?
I wish I could be more gracious but --
When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
Those things never work. Never.
-- should go back. Now!
I'm in charge. We go back!
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
Well good n-
Good night.
Red, I --
Miss Sherman, he's asking you back, but it's entirely your choice.
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
What -- ?
Oh, sod you.
It'll go in.
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
HE did. I've seen him.
You can keep them.
First things first. You can have a telephone when we've talked. Do you know who did this to you?
Come to Daddy.
That's right. Who are you?
Forget him.
I'm very happy.
Tell me who you are.
What do you want me to do.
Good.
Keep your voice down.
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
So you were cheated.
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
Just to your left.
The keys are in the kitchen.
This afternoon.
I thought half of it was your brother's?
It looks like a bomb's dropped.
Larry....
Anyway, it's bad luck to see too much of the bride before the wedding.
Don't go upstairs.
I don't know where to begin...
What are you talking about?
Oh?
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
I prefer the floor.
YOU'D like my room.
It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
O.K.
It's like she's waiting for something.
Of course.
I want to see.
We walk.
Are you alright ?
What happened to you?
Play it.
Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
"Our customers?" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?
We can take your car.
What do you mean, "what?"
The band that found me and asked me to join.
Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are.
That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready.
What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --
Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma?
Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
It's the new --
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?
-- It was Dean, you fucking idiot.
No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
Oh.  Okay.
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
What's his name?
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The one on Testament of Youth.  Never released here.  Japanese import only.
Okay.
Yeah.
I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
I dunno.
My house?
You really believe that?
What, what?
Rob.  Don't be childish.
You won't like it.
We'll talk some other time.
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.
You don't ever think about other people?
Is that the last of it?
You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
You're being deliberately obtuse.
God, that's a cold and a half.  Maybe you should bet back in bed.
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
Sure.  I'll see you on Friday.
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
What about Ian?
I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure.  I just... I need you, Rob.  That's it.  And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so...
Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
How?  How were we the same people?
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
Where?
Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this?
Right.
Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
Isn't that how it is for everybody?
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
When I said before that I hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, I was, you know... talking about breakfast and stuff.
That way.
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
I knew this was going to happen.
Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
I'm Vince.
What's the name of your label?
Claymore.
No.
It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
Grave robbers?
I've been to Church Hill.
I doubt that.  Good day, Miss Cartwright.
Dupont Circle.
And you?
You?
Go home.
No.  I had to talk to you.
It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.
A little dusty.
Yes.
Why are you here?
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
I'd like you to try.
I haven't killed _you_.
Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
What is it you want?
Will I see you again?
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
Spare me the details.
It'll never stick.
You're an asshole, Moran.
I want Taupin.
Yeah.
Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.
What are you doing man?
Aye.
Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic.
Yes.  Always.
Does it change with me in the room?
It is the truth.
No!
You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
You'd have to die first.  Aqui.
But we cannot be killed.
Again.  Try again.
Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.
I feel hardly nothing.
I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
With the proper tools, Conor, a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one.
I don't understand.  Not a week ago your father gave us his blessing.
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.
Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
Stay out of it.
Must he go?
Your father must be smart.
None of this would be happening if you hadn't run...
How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
-Since you last saw me.
You were never a kid.
No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
You don't run as hard, MacLeod. You just don't run as hard anymore.
That's none of your business.
They were Steven, they were.  It's been a miracle it has.  He lasted right through and healed.  No one in the village has ever seen anything like it.  Ever.
His only kid.
Open this door!
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
Exactly!
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
I could get a company doctor in twenty minutes.
Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
Oh, yes. Here it is.
I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
Yes, I know...  Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
I don't blame them.
I feel I ought to take care of her.
Well, I'm independent, too.
If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
That's the kind of stuff they want!
Say, I want to be sure, too!
You'll ask me to what?
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
No, you don't!
He's insane or drunk or something. Why, if this unfortunate man, Williams, has really been reprieved, I personally am tickled to death. Aren't you, Pete?
Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
You can break it, can't you?
I know, Walter, but I --
You've got to help me, Hildy.
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
I'm not working for any other paper!
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
Too bad I couldn't see this guy first. I'm pretty particular about whom my wife marries.
Say, could I meet him?
Now you got me.
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
I know, but --
Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
Where's some paper?
Is he coming back here?
You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.
If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything.  Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it.  Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?
What is it? Here!
Murder, uh?
Don't tell me you were worried!
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
What's the matter with my brains?
Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?
It'll be Heaven!
You know you did!
Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.
First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
They're always after me for interviews.
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen.
Yes, sir.
It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.
Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
Now, where is he?
Little rum in yours, too?
Let go o' me. What's the idea?
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
Cover up that transmitter!
Now what do you say?
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
Go on -- shoot me!
My name is Louis Peluso.
I'm telling you!
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
I'll take it.  What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!
I made it up just now, and who's asking you?  I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.
Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
What are your beliefs, Earl?
No, no, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody. All I want to do is be let alone.
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
Wait a minute, Mollie.
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
Shut up, you!
I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
I'll explain it tomorrow!
A very fine-looking women.
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
I know.
Why?
But Grandpa, you said...
Yes.
Ask her yourself.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
Air-raid?
Didn't you feel the house rock? You must have seen all those shell bursts.
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
I don't know?
I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
Jam is jam! It's just jam!
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
Don't leave it like that. Go after him. Swallow your pride.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
Or what?
How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.
Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
Clive had a job. I didn't. I couldn't.
Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights.
Happy as can be. In the old groove.
Really, that's a long time.
I know I hate Swiss cheese, the holes make me nervous.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.
OK.
Yeah, come on.
A dead one.
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.
Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about?  A great American.
Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway.
Hot has got nothing to do with it.
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
No... yeah, they ripped him to pieces while his family watched from the car. The wife is screaming, the kids are crying. Some dude in another car filmed the whole thing.
No problem.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
There's not enough room.
What?
What I need are some answers. 
Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.
Enough talk, write.
Can I get some stamps off ya?  Did you fix the toilet yet?
He should be back in a couple hours.
Tickets for what?
Help, help us.
I resign.
Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio.
Yep, I found something.
Enough with the stupid voices.
I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.
Oh, it's real... as real as I want it to be, mamma...  ...look, see the magic in my brush strokes.
You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.
Yes! I'm the one who beats you when you're bad...
I ain't got a warrant.
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
I pray to God there is.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
I always favored the Hulk.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
Anyway, there's not much else out that way... so, I figure maybe there's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms.
And think about what you've done.
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
Oui.
Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
Stop. Get away.
Take me, darling! Tame your little monkey of love!
We have nothing to say! You are a rotten bastard, that's what!
What?
No. You look so beautiful.
I've moved on.
That's not how he tells it.
Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
I want to be the way I was before.
I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
Ouch. Yeah?
Shut up and tell me.
Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
Won't he be able to tell?
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
No. I married a midget.
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
I have a friend you might like to meet.
Lila, I want to help you.
Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
Yes, and...
I like you, too, Nathan.
You do?
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
That's a great idea.
Of course.
If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...
It's perfect!
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote Janet Jackson.
Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
You are an animal.
Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
Extra dessert?
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines.
Lots of action. Lots of money.  Lots of class. You'll see some of the best-dressed and most beautiful women in the world at the races. Knock your eye out.
Oh, I forgot all about it.  How's the hands?
For whom and for what?
How?
The night is two thousand dollars old.
I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
Whaddya been so far?
No, we don't talk. I don't make bad bets. Seventy-five, twenty-five. That's it.
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
Play it again. Learn something.  Fats went in the john, see? Washed his face, cleaned his fingernails, made his mind a blank, combed his hair, came back all ready to go.  You were through. You saw him, you saw how he looked. Clean, all set to start all over again. Hold tight and push hard. You know what you were doing? You were waitin' to get beat. Flattened out on your butt, swimmin' around in glory. And whisky. Probably deciding how you could lose.
Nah. Sit tight. He'll be over here.
Well, I win sometimes.
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
All right, then. I'll play him with my own money.
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
Comes right in this poolroom every night, eight o'clock on the nose. Just stay where you are. He'll find you.
Well, now... I mean, you figure I'm a little drunk, and I'm loaded on the hip, and you just want in, real friendly, while the money's still floating, huh? Okay... Go ahead. Set 'em up.
Charlie, I'm gonna take him.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of pool for a thousand dollars a game.
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
Is that what you think?
Would you like to come out tonight?
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
What bus?
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
Museums... art galleries... concerts.
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
Oh, it's not bad.
Me. It's Eddie.
I got beat up. They...  They broke my thumbs.
Nothin'.  Want another drink?
He went off someplace.
California. Oakland.
That's right.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
Now I know why they call you Fast Eddie. Eddie, you talk my kind of talk...  Sausage! Rack 'em up!
Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.
You name it.
Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?
Listen to me, my blood somehow... helped you.  It could help all of you.  We could find some way to --
Do you want to go on?
I don't know.
Shhh... don't talk.
I want to talk.  I just learned again.
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
Stay alive.
It was at Diane's party in Malibu and I had just broken up with Todd and I was loaded for bear, any man who had the nerve to come at me -- watch out.  So you come sauntering in -- you know that saunter you do. That watch out, baby, here comes Mr. Smooth thing.
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
That's the Air Force Base.
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
It was so real, Dad.
Better now, son?
Yes -- but ...
He was upset with moving, I believe.
I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.
Yes.
She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
We'll be very careful.  But we have to see.  If something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there?
What?
You have to leave the White House.
This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...
Then get them out of there.
What's the bad news?
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
A cold? Of course.
I can't shake her free.
It's not me. They're overriding the system.
I had a feeling you would.
But what, General?
Well, er... it's slowing down.
It's... slowing down, Sir.
Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
Dick-weed!
You know me...
I know, you like to make a big entrance.
Butt-munch.
I'm a dancer.
Don't be. I'm not. It's good money.  'Side, he's worth it.
How to kiss ass.
It's all fuzzy.
Damn it, he was doing you a favor. You know how hard it is to find someone who doesn't think you're completely crazy? What are we supposed to do now? Huh? Where are we supposed to go now?
Well, I guess you'd like to see the big tamale? Follow me.
What do you want us to do?
Yes. Now we know.
Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
Arghhh! Oh!
What?
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
An old man's dream.
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway.
I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
You know something, Doctor Jones? You're absolutely right.
Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
Pretty sure.
He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!
What?
What were they looking for?
No?
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
Then wait -- count to twenty.
I came to get you! What do you think?
Well, what was left of him.
If only I could have been with you.
Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
What?
I'm out, Dad!
But what are they? Can't you remember?
What about Marcus?
Marcus would agree with me.
This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
And do I detect a rebuke?
What does that mean?
Who are you?
No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
The British worry so about their Empire -- it makes us feel like well- cared-for children.
Miss Scott panicked?
Well, I don't know... we came here from a small village and the peasants there told us that the Pankot Palace was growing powerful again -- because of some ancient evil.
I don't like to show off.
Okey-doke, Indy! Hold onto your potatoes!
Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.
"Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth."
Why?
What?
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.
Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!
You're betrayed Shiva. 
He told me they knew I was coming here.
Their children?
Can you move your arm?
It's starting to let go!
I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
Maybe he likes older women.
So now they believe me.
No... they won't kill me.
You got it!
What for?
I'm going to puke in it...
I'm...inside you.
It wasn't him.
Who was it?
I see...
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
Why don't we go home?
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
Right.
I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
No.
You've heard of U.S.T.?
I just went there for a job.
What for?
Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
Of course you do!
Who was that? Somebody out there?
Why don't you?
Why?
Yeah...Who is?
Thanks.
Don't know.
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
We get on a plane.
I can't do that.
Who cares?
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
You'll be me.
Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
The beach?
Eat it?
Try another language.
Wait.
Without your pants.
This...is not going to work out.
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
Doesn't.
What glasses.
Killer!
What if she says something important?
What she say. What'd you get out of her?
It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.
I told you, I have a feeling...
Drink lots of water.
I don't trust her.
Cash.
He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him.
Don't worry, I can.
Gimme a minute.
Keep thinking.
She works for them.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
They can?
You're lovely.
Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
It'll remind me of you.
What part what?
Good.
In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.
Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
Newer, more powerful design.
We don't even know where to start. What about these people? What do we do with them?
He work for us?
That crazy guy?
Yes. Joe.
Hey, sit in the car. I'll get you a fee. Make up for what you lost on the tour.
He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt!
It is to me too.
You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?
Oh.
Thanks.
Well what?
Oh....Sure.
I will?
Take the card.
Whatever it is, don't do it.
I said...I didn't say..anything!
I am sort of scattered.
Can I help?
Are you alright?
If I was with you, I wouldn't
You did.
...Naw. Made that up.
Who do you work for?
Why didn't you tell me?
You seemed interesting.
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
This business is over.
Too late, they won't come back out till morning.
What?
Oh.
He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
What'd...you forget?
What did you tell them?
For you.
I was...crazy...desperate. I took it out on you. I didn't mean it. I know what she sees in you. You're kind and you're brave. If I ever get out of you, I'll be glad to call you my friend.
What?
Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
Like Al says..."Under stress, the human body is capable of impossible feats.
...Piece of mind.
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
Why?
No?
She was playing with the Pooh doll.
Can I go over to Janeane's house?
What's that outside, Daddy?
Three hours.
You got a deal. 
Yeah. Catch you later.
Okay.
What do you mean, what's it do?
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
It's an alternate version. So what if we have an alternate version? And I don't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable.
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
Are you sure?
How grave?
"Mike?"
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
You ready...?
Don't you have to be at the office?
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
"60 Minutes"?
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
Who is this?
Alright.
You eating with us?
In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
Black, black...
If you want to do it.
I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
...okay.
You charge by the hour?
I don't think you really understand --
I'll call them, Lowell.
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
What?
He doesn't seem to be listening...
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
Where you staying now?
A delivery device for nicotine.
It acts as a drug on the body?
My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
Seven...
Chapter and verse.
That's why we hire scientists...
I just want to make sure that you both --
Here's her picture...
No frown lines.  New watch?
It was a gift from a client.
Set one side for Bel Air.
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
What?
Thanks, buddy.
Yes?
That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
Maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
I told you. I was hungry.
What is it you're after, Miles?
Well, don't look at mine!
And you've always loved him?
Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
Howard is a beautiful person.
I figure a couple of months. That's how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry.
Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
Apparently she was very disappointed.
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
I know.
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
Hello Marylin.
I love you. I want to have your baby.
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
Meaning my house.
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
You have to leave the house immediately!
Now. But first, he worked for you.
Marylin?
Are you alright? You lost weight.
My whole metabolism is -- off.
Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
Of Massey Myerson?
So where are you now?
Get this! He called and invited me to dinner.
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
Well, that's about to change big time.
I guess.
Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
Did Marylin end up with money?
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
You know what I mean when I say "it."
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?
She brought my digestive enzymes.
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
Should we counsel fear -- or trust? Should we seek to destroy -- or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love?
Mother?
No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well... no.
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in—
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
You were taken for a buggy ride?
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
I hope you're not comparing yourself to Napoleon. He was a strategist. Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe.
Why not?  Look what he's doing for aviation. It takes courage to do what he does. And character! At least he's accomplished something worthwhile. I suppose you'd like to have me marry a business man. Well, I hate business men—particularly if you're a shining example.
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scare—I—when I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
Who is he?
Why? Do you know him? 
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
You talk as if—
I haven't the slightest idea.
Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
Thanks.
Oh, yeah?
Driver!
Quit kidding!  It's all over the front pages, You know, I've always been curious about the kind of a girl that would marry King Westley.
No. It'd be useless. Father'd get the wire before they would.
That's none of your business.
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
Oh, this?—I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
Outside!
Like what?
I thought maybe—uh—"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
Um. You're doing all right.
I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day.
Don't look at me. I didn't marry King Westley.
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
Yes.
Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!
You're crazy.
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
What!
Here. Eat your head off.
Holy Jumping Catfish! You can drive a guy crazy.
Doesn't sound very exciting.
You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for you—carrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught me—goodnight!
What if nobody stops for us?
Come on—get in.
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
Me?
Congratulations.
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
When does the bus leave?
Thank you.
Husband?
Yes—if he is your husband.
If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that—
You're drunk.
A trumpet?
"How would you like to have the story, you big tub of—of—"
That feller last night, that's who! He was gonna stay a week, huh? Well, he's skipped. Took the car with him, too. We wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if I hadn't took that magnesia.  Come on, get up, don't lay there. Let's do something about it.
Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time. 
What's on your mind?
Five G's—or I crab the works.
You're a pretty shrewd baby.  We better get away from this gang. Talk this thing over privately.
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to—
Why—no—
You're not kidnapping her, are you?
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
You, Numa?
You're not digging.
The anonymous kind, Chief.
Old stains, Bill, but just as telling.
We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
Where you going, boss?
There's a word - orders.
Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?
If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim. 
I did.
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
No, I did not.
Dave?
What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
It leads farther than that.
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
But he never writes, speaks, or does any propaganda for the Russians.  He meets Marina, whose uncle is a colonel in Soviet intelligence, at a trade union dance; she thinks he's Russian the way he speaks, six weeks later they marry, have a daughter.
Goddamn!  They put Oswald together from Day One!  Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas - you just move him around a board.  Sent him to Russia, in and out, no passport problems.  You got the word "microdots" in his notebook, you got the Minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions, the sealed DIZ201 personnel file. For all we know, there could be a dozen Oswalds in different cities, countries - all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination.  Does the real Oswald know he's been put together?  Who knows.  It doesn't matter, does it?  He's a low level spy, he doesn't know who he really works for...
This is interesting - are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
A Willie O'Keefe?
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.
We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Don't be.  Nothing to be scared about, honey, I been through four years of war - this is nothing.
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
Call me Willie.  I ain't got nuthin' but time, Mr. Garrison.  Minutes, hours, days, years of'em.  Time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road...
What are you driving at, boss?
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
How many men?
One shooter.  One spotter on a radio. Maybe three teams.  I'd say these were professional riflemen, chief, serious people.  Hunters...  patient. It takes skill to kill with a rifle, that's why there's been no execution of an executive with one in 200 years... "3-2-1...  green!"  Or else "Abort!  Abort!"
Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
You sure got it.  You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!
Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.
I'm not with the Agency, Mr. Garrison, and I assume if you've come this far, what I have to say interests you.  But I'm not going to name names, or tell you who or what I represent. Except to say - you're close, you're closer than you think...
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
More than ten years.
I don't know if I should talk about this.
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
And Oswald?
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
You just need some sleep, Lou.  It won't look so bad when...
Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
But then you told her you were home.
I understand.
You.
That's why they call it "fuckin' with ya." Now you wanna hear how we retaliate?
What?
What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
Look, man, I know I owe you --
You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
What's she willing to give us?
Every step of this goes in my report.  I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag.
While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?
Okay.
Who do you think I am?
It's kind of a sports bar
I am, as a matter of fact.
Yeah, if I cooperate.
Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?
I am. Have a seat.
I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.
Bigger?
How was it?
For now. These relationships never last too long.
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
You talk them into it?
They seem to like the idea.
Bring the money in and they follow it?
You think he's got a thing for you?
Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
You're avoiding the question.
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
You do that?
It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money.
All he needed was a reasonable explanation.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
On the phone I told him I have the ten thousand he put up for your bond. I could bring the money and the papers for him to sign. Walk out and call the Sheriff's department.
It's not that simple.
Tell him you want to see him?
I didn't say you did.
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
Madrid or Barcelona?
What if I plead guilty?
If I don't cooperate?
If I'm working, I can help you.
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
I thought you were going to let this one through.
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
What did you say?
Was she there?
She didn't say.
Right. Everything's the same, except one change...
Yes. All those things are true.
But you didn't do that.
Not in the fitting room.
I have no idea.
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
It looks good on you.
And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.
They told me.
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
Way I see it, me and you only got one thing to talk about. What you willing to do for me?
It's okay. I forgive you. Now, let's say if I tell on you, I walk. And if I don't, I go to jail.
I do okay.
They already know it's you.
What did they say?
A woman.
Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
How do you know she did that?
Well, I've been trusting you all this time, haven't I? We agreed on ten percent of what you bring in and that's what you gonna get.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
Uh-huh.
Bank robbery.
What's a Metrix?
It's a diet thing?
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
No.
Must of made quite an impression.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
And your point is?
Gimme that bag before I knock you out and take it.
What's your cost?
Sure.  We almost done, ain't we?
Now play the volume as loud as you want but don't touch my levels. I got them set just the way I want 'em.
I know you don't know. I said guess.
I'm in my underwear.
He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
She believed you?
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'
What?
The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.
Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
Cops can't locate him, huh?
I think I do. Is that good enough?
You think you could do that?
You go wait in the car. Wait a minute.
Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
Beaumont ain't going nowhere.  Where do I sign?
Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
They decided to no-file. Tell me where you are and I'll bring you your money.
Well, give it to me then.
All I did was walk out with it.
My office.
She was afraid.
That I gotta see.
You expect me to just walk in there?
Yeah.
It's Beaumont.
He leave town?
Where do you want to go?
I'm okay.
LET GO!
There's nothing to expose.
They're not interested, Jake.
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
Maybe the demons are real.
Don't bother to call again, okay?
But the paper ...
Excuse me a minute. I'll be right back.
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just give it a try.
Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
Yes.
I don't know what to say.
New? He's been here for years.
Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
Whataya mean, no record?
Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
She was good in bed, though.
What do you mean?
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
What?
I don't like things that make you cry.
When was the last time I said a word?
Come on. What were they, Jake?
Hey, I'm here.
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
Are you out of your mind?
It's so hard to believe.
Sit down.
You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
West.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
Shows how much you knew.
Like it was yesterday.
Because I can get rid of the demons. I can block the Ladder. I have an antidote. We can kill them off, chemically speaking. They'll all disappear. It's chemistry, my friend. I know. I created it. Come with me. I can help.
Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me.
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
Yeah, you and everyone else.
Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
A long time.
I need to see you.
Nope.
I don't know.
Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
They're waitin' for me, that's why.
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
We don't have a choice!
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
Get out of here!
I'm coming, I'm coming.
You just keep an eye out.
What?
Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down.
Oh man, what the hell happened?
Fuckin A...
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance.
Med-kit?
It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.
Okay, good tip.
Old woman?
More time...shit, she's had 400 years...
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
Blew half his skull away, one leg, one arm and left his entrails stretched across the lab. And look at me! I'm covered in his filthy blood!
Defense droids. I'm on it.
I just know.
Keep trying!
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
Alright, I'm . . .  No way . . . is this a joke?
Obviously so.
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
Get him out of there!
You wanna die?
That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's ass at a spelling bee!
My boat's neat, dad!
You got it.
You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark...
Dead astern! Zig-zag!
Don't be silly -– You're going to make summer better for them...
Ow.  He's gotta be more careful in the water...
He's sitting in it.
Michael! Come inside!
I am Chief of Police. I can do anything I want.  You want to come?
No. Home here.
I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
I was only reacting to what I was told.
Martin, we hired the best man we could find.
I'm going home.
What kind of a shark did you say it was?
August! Tomorrow is the 4th of July, and we are going to open for business. It's going to be our best summer in years. If you're so concerned about the beaches, you two, you do whatever you have to to keep them safe, but with you or without you, the beaches stay open this weekend.
I don't know if I can do that without a...
You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
It's called Territoriality. It's a theory.
You could say that.
Florida license plate.
What do we do?
I want to check something. Hold my feet.
It's a whale out there.
I can't stand here doing nothing!
Just keep kicking.
I didn't know her.
And nobody else saw her in the water?
We never had any. What's the problem?
What else could've done that?
Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
I do.  But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
Martin hates boats. Hates the water. On the ferry to the mainland, he sits in the car the whole way over. He's got this childhood thing, there's a clinical word for it.
He's busy.
We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.
C'mon, it'll give us time to think about what they're going to say.
Transplants?
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...
What do you see?
Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure...
Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
Whose idea was it?
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.
Leah just told me you were going with her.
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!
Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?
No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
It does?
Just like our moms and teachers!
What a trip, man.
Me neither. But I'm going to stop wearing underpants in order to raise my sperm count. See you.
No... I guess not.
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
Hon, did you get expelled?
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
Geeeerta Rauuuss!
What do you play?
Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
You don't have to do that.
Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me.
You're gonna like this, I promise.
You do?
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
God, you're so young.
Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
Nothing.
Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?
You're pregnant?
Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
Tore up from the floor up?
I am a suicide risk.
Unfortunately, yes.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.
It was magnificent, man!
Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.
What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. It's called "nesting."
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
I suppose anything's possible.
Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day.
He whips you?
You can?
Could I try that?
Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
No sir.
Wonder what all them people done made him so mad?
Ain't you goin' to record it?
Well, let's put it this way.  I need me a new woman.
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
Why?
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
Fuck!
A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free.
Who are you?
Without his car?
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
With how many people?
Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't.
Was up bitch?
You fucked it?
How did she smell? Did her puss stink?
And for a second I felt a little bit guilty. You know, because she's young and all. And then I was like, oh shit, that turns me on. I wanna fuck this little baby girl.
To what? Virgins?
You think?
It is right.
The cartoon?
Right.
Right.
No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends.
He looks like my uncle.
It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.
Why I do what?
That.
What are you talking about?
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
Good luck?
Yeah.
What do ya want with Telly? That guy has enough bitches.
Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
Yeah?
I don't want you to hurt me.
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
Because your a virgin?
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
15.
One.
No.
Yeah, I guess so.
Thanks.
Well then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You forget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My grandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, "Leon, my darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't think. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't talk" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be happier.
Hello Paul. Is Telly inside?
I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
Foreplay. Foreplay.
Whah is dissdee?
Because he can like climax you up to that...
Yep.
It's like...
You think so?
What?!
Shh.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.
Yeah. I had sex with Jake, and it took him like an hour and a half.
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
You ever do any hunting, Peter?
Homesearchers.
I'm positive.
Sit down!
You think he's dirty?
Anything?
Maybe you're reaching a bit?  I think Sanderson should be in on this. There's a reason why the killer's calling him.
It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
Why her?
It's me you want.  Not her.
He's in his seventies and lives in Holland.
Why did he what?
Come here.
I'm Kathy.
He went down to the lobby for a minute. He should be right back.  Would you like come in?
Boys.
No... but I can tell.  A woman knows these things.
Mrs. Lutz.  She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.
Nothing.
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
How long has she been dead?
But we heard him.
Anything else?
It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.
This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- He could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
I signed the confession.  What about the car?
He knows you're aware of that.
Feel like practicing?
Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
"Carefully".  "Carefully". "Carefully".
When I was very young.
It seems like such a complicated game.
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
She could be dead after the game.
That's not fair!
No -- I'm not involved.  And I plan on keeping it that way.
How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
How could you?  Unless you were there.
Why?
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
Alright.  What about me?
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
What?  By attacking me?
Does anyone?
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
It could be anything.
I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
I don't have to go through with it either.
Well, then you can go up to the parapet and I'll hand the buckets up to you.
Never mind my ears! Go away!
I can't.
Colwyn.
No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
All the passages are guarded.
Yes.
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
You have rope?
I am too old to climb down a rope.
You won't have to.
Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?
No. She must agree of her own free will.
Never.
Yes.
You must never know her name.  If more than one approaches, she will certainly kill them. Alone I may have a chance.
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
What will happen?
Yes.
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
He saved our lives.
<u>What</u>? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues.
Fame?  Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun.
You will follow me.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
Yes, my lord.
We'll meet you at the inn.
Can't I come, too?
I ...  ... am Titch.
You had better manners as a pig.
I am Ergo the Magnificent, and I do not travel with thieves and robbers.
Oh, my poor stomach.
Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ...  ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.
We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.
How many did you lose?
No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen.
She had another name once.
Ynyr!
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
You had a son.
Where is he? My son.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
Huh? I see, but this is the FBI, little girl, and I can't let you in.  But if you leave me his money, I'll give him it myself.
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
Come on, shit, tell me! Is he beautiful?
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
Whoever.
OK.
I never rent my gear.
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
I think.
Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
Mathilda, listen!
I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
...Composer.
Huh... Yeah, yeah... Of course.
Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
I know... But I'm a little pressed.
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
Then...
I received my B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania, my P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College.  I worked three years at the Boston University School of Medicine, during which time I had articles printed in the "Journal of Educational Psychology", "American Journal of Psychology", "Psychology Review" and "Science"... So I think it's safe to say my opinion is valid.
She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
I finish the walk, and then we may take all the chances we want.
A.P.B.... He isn't breaking any law.  He's a grown man... He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that's what he wants to do.
We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
It's hard to say.  It's a delicate surgery.  There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.
Pardon?
You do?
Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas, because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other... I know it's not New Years, because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance... and I'm sure it's not our anniversary, because I didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, 'Pick out something pretty'... Yes -- Maurice -- I'm virtually certain it's not a special day today.
What?
What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement.
Exactly.  No reason.  No occasion. It just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how...  How come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me?
Show me.
You can change.
He's plastered.
Pacifica, California.
I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up.
You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.
This is the route approved by triple A.  Even if you followed back roads the entire way, you'd still be looking at roughly the same distance...
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
California.
... To look me in the eye and say what's important to you isn't as important to me?  To tell me you know what's best?  To tell me life is more precious than what I feel for my wife?
Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
Steph.
Mr. Parker, I'm supposed to give you your fish sticks.
Did you tell him everything you wanted to?  Did you do everything you could while he was here?
You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four.
Hello.
How are you feeling?
He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.
What do you mean?
We did a piece after your story ran in the New York Times.
No alcohol?
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
You were going to get my door.
Yes, that's right.
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
I know that...
...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
Do you want me not to go tonight?
They wouldn't know.
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
I don't know. I'll find out though.
What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard?
I don't need backups. Harvard is the school I'm going to.
You understand you're on trial for murder?
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
To me it is. He doesn't trust me. Why should I trust him?
He did leave a Cher tape in the pool house once --
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
No. I was in the shower.
Huh?
He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.
I don't know.
Well, I recommend knowing before speaking. The law leaves much room for interpretation -- but very little for self-doubt.
Cried a lot and gained twenty pounds. Dewey kept the trailer and my precious baby Rufus. I got jackcrap.
She could use some mascara and some serious highlights, but she's not completely unfortunate-looking.
No.
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
Yes, he is.
Thank you. I love you, too.
But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
Margot!
Wow. I'm glad I met you.
Aside from that.
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
No, she can't move for an hour.
Helloo... he just had lunch with his grandmother. You know he got "The Rock".
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
Of course, I do!
I guess it'll have to...
Of course.
That's why I think it's time for us to --
No.
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
Uh -- sure.
Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --
Thank you.
How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on?
Really?
Where?
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
Precisely.  Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
What do you want with me?
And you... are you not also afraid?
Why should I kill you?  A simple course in etiquette... something your parents sadly overlooked.
Oh, yes...
I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!
Might we watch, too?
Precisely, my darling.  Your animal strength, your primitive power has surfaced... you are what you desire.
We be honored, friend Ogg.
Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
Dance, Jack!  The night's but begun.
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...
Then, what's gone wrong?  Why did it happen?
Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.
Have we turned grave-robber, then?
What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
No false modesty, lad.  You're a proper champion.  Achilles' armor sits on you like it was forged to fit.
Aye!  That too.
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
Blackheart?
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
Ogg's footprints!
Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
Easily spoken...
Never mind.  Just do it!  Retrieve the arrows somehow.
Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --
Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
Did you bring me here to sup?
Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?
Patience, lad.
Ah, but you will.  And so will the Baron, when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway.
Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!
I could have struck off his head just now!
On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --
She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
You're good at riddles... Find the ring and the spell is broken.
Good, lad... Here, Jack, give me a hand with the windlass... There's a good fellow...
If you like.
Liar!
Stop complaining.
I detest serpents.
What shall we do?
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
My lady mocks me.
Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
Tis not fit for a princess.
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
You've freed me, Jack...
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
And I love you, my husband.
Pinching me!
Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.
Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
What became of the princess?
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
No need for bells, Jack.  I'll nay enchant ye.
No fear of that now.
I'd be honored.
Only that?
I'm promised to another!
Please...
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
Bah!  You faeries have the morals of ferrets.
Jimmy Squarefoot no lost.
You do know where it is?
To Castle Couer de Noir?
That very nice.
I guess it depends on what you give up on.
He's here.  Check the bathroom.
I checked everywhere.  He's not there.
It's so beautiful.
I would have anyway.
Red.
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
You'd better call and cancel.
Oh God, we don't want the police!
Are you his friend?
No.
What's that?
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
No thanks.
Why are you so uptight?
Josh said...
You'd hate him for the trick.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
You've been good this week.
A violation?
A sink?
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
Which is why we bid out a quarter of our projects.  It doesn't make a lot of sense anymore to want what we don't have and don't want what we do.
How old are you?
What are you talking about?  You love your job.
For everything.
Thank you.
Uh huh.
I want you both to stay.
I don't know.
You'll know me by the time we're through.
I'm not going!
I'll hate you forever.
No you don't.
It bugs me.
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
You'll have money when you work for it.
I don't know.
I might have a solution.
What are you now?
Nothing.
I gave up on you.
Why wouldn't she leave?
After everything.
Well, congratulations!  You fucking pulled it off!
I don't let him.  He just loves to.
Money?
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
The only time I can think of for sure, I was holding onto Sam in the ocean, saving him from the waves.
Oh...with his ear infection!
No, I'm...thanks.  I took something.
I'll find something that won't kill them.
What is it with this?  They wouldn't spend less time with Peter if they lived here!  He has no time!
You need to know what?  Do I still love you?
I didn't think you'd come today.
What?
No.
I'm thinking it's too weird now.
Should I?
So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
Despite you.
I'll be in the bedroom.
This is what he wants.
Dad's home, already?
In the bedroom.
She's doing just fine.
Come on, Biscuit, this is good news. Your mama's gonna break down in tears when you show up on her doorstep.
I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
I'm not your boss. Not anymore.
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
We'll see what those slippers feel like after, say, 24 hours. And if you step down off them bottles -- if one toe so much as touches the dirt -- one of these boys is gonna shoot you dead. Let's see. We need a special man for this job.
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
Claude Banks.
Start your job? What kind of job?
Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars.
Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
I call it like I see it, and what I see is definitely soft.
What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.
There are people down there having fun. I want to be one of them. I want you to be one of them. On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash.
What about you, Radio?
He just blocked it out. Nigger's crazy. He's the one who did all the stabbing. He's capable of some heinous shit.  How 'bout him down there?
You know what I'm saying.
Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
Getting a map from a chubby chef named Cookie? Dragging our asses through the swamps in search of some worm-eaten boat? That ain't a plan, that's a vacation for two in the hole. When you've got a map to New York City, you get back to me.
What do you want, Claude?
My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.
At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.
Then I have nothing left to say to you.
After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
'Course I was right. About what?
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
So?
I'm sorry, he's on medication...
No problem. Oh, boy!
You heard the boss! Let's move!
C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.
I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with.
Don't worry about that. Hey, fellas, this here is my mama. These are some of my friends. That's Willie, there's Poker Face, Radio, Cookie, Goldmouth, Biscuit, Jangle Leg.
What difference does it make? Natchez was better off without Winston Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? At least the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
No, it says Marleen here.
What are you in for, Willie?
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
They run but they never get too far.
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
Please, get out of my mind!
How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
...their damned souls will be ours.
It's our time, brother.
You mother...
Noon...
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
Show him Central Park.
Try an angel.
Well tell her I said "hi" back.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores.
He superimposed your head onto "Scarface."
Everything's fine, pop.
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
Thanks.
You got it.
It's Stanley, sir.
Should we wake him up?
The Dark Prince is here.
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
My dad's an optometrist.
"Octopus people?"
Uh, it's a deep south expression.
Are you dead?
What do you mean, "possessed?"
..."The Devil?"...
That was Cassius!
It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
A black guy?
If it's Cassius, yes.
No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
Did you ever see anybody renew?
Here.
Why aren't you in Nursery?
Sad? What made you sad?
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
I changed my mind.
So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
Maybe... sure...
Thanks... but I have the choice.
Why tell me?
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
I have.
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
They won't listen.
You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,
Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
Mother and Father said so... you know?
Oh, my...
Hello.
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
No -- Look, I'm in a hurry.
Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
I have always been here...
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
What do you mean by that?
I don't know.
Okay, then, I'll take you to dinner.
Me, too.
I can't see you tonight.
No... no.
What deal?
How'd it happen, Alice?
Okay.
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
Oh, yeah?... What else?
Up the stairs - down the hall.
Alice?
Did you tell the police this?
You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
What's the word on the street?
You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
I... I didn't say anything...
My... My head.
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
At your house. Don't you remember?
That's why I married you.
Wake me up when you get home.
A videotape.
Does it say anything on the tape?
When you didn't come to the club.
You were asleep when I got home, yes.
Yeah?
All right.
Thanks, guys.
But...
No... of course not.
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
Who is this?
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
Let me have it.  "Aboard the S.S. Manchuria. Last night Conway seemed to recover his memory. Kept talking about Shangri- La, telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet. Insisted upon returning there at once. Locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at Singapore. Am leaving ship myself to overtake him, as fearful of his condition. Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri-La which I am forwarding. Lord Gainsford."
Yes. Those are our own people. They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too hazardous.
Yes.
Fossils.
Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
Okay, brother.
I beg your pardon.
Good morning—
Will you stop squawking!
Yes.
The police?
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people—
Okay, Lovey.
And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
I'll say.
Not for me, thanks. No, I'm too weary.
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
Over by that hill.
Look, Bob!
Leaving?
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
The only one.
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
You get out of here! If any of you men think you can come busting in here-
Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
Then it's done.
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
You?
Yes.
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
Is that all my story meant to you?
I'd go mad!
She's going with me.
Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
We'd be eternally grateful if you—
Yes. Hold this pigeon.
Yes.
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?
You see, it's not a dream.
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
Because mother read it in a book somewhere, and if mother's little darling doesn't take her fingers out of the salad bowl this instant, mother's going to wring her little neck.
Forgiven.  You know, when we were on that plane, I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane, and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life I've been rushing up and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms.
You'll wait till you rot!
Perhaps.
I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about your choice of targets.
It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.
They don't.  Now, son.  If you get the job, you're going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways.  Here's a little piece of advice:    Don't use this so much.
Actually, sir--
We wear black.
So what's the problem?
I know, but we're on a college campus...
You don't know me at all.
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
What?
I think that's what's happening...
Get back in the car!
That's my point.  For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  He said our enemy in already here.  Well maybe it is.  Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.
Since as long as we've been keeping records...
All of it?
Kay, you're scaring your partner.
You know, there's something we never really thought of...
Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?
I'd prefer if you were just a little more blunt.
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.
You figured what?
Come on now.  People are smart.
I dunno. One?
It's... coming.
Nope.  Nothing at all.
Tell us the truth.  You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood.
Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.
So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
Dee?  What are you doing here?
They went to the President? Directly? THEY WENT OVER OUR HEADS?
I have to find out what happened to my life.  Agatha.  I'm not going to kill the man.  I don't even know him.
Someplace safe.
I have to go back.
The other two will die without me.
That's comforting.
Organic microbots that reconstruct the nerves and blood vessels. It'll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs.  But whatever you do, don't scratch.
-- go blind.  I know.
For that, we have to go for a ride.
... Graveyard shift.
On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
Try again.
You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
What?
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
Everybody runs.
No maglev system.
What?
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
It helps if you don't think of them as human.
She grabbed you?  Impossible.  The Precogs aren't even aware of us. In the milk all they see is the future.
Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
I was looking for you...
I wanted to.
Tell me!
The vine -- the Baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall...
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
Why?
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
If... you have one.
Oh, God, what did you do?
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
You look great.
I was, but this whole incident with John made me realize the fragility of what we've built here.  This is John's legacy as much as mine and I want to protect that.
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
He's my subordinate!
Not quite.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
Yes.
Two?
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
That was our apartment.
What was it then?
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
Not very well, I'm sure.  I'd probably start doping myself.  Or maybe I'd...
But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
What are you talking about?
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
You're Bobby, right?
You sure? I just made it.
Then put my Martel's in a snifter.
What's 'incidentals?'
Yeah. Take it.
Thank you very much, sir.
What, sir?
Thank you, sir.
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
Bullshit.
Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
Mommy's not home?
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
Go.
Shhh. He'll hear you.
Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
Come on, dude. The other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. I know the drill, I'll wear a rubber --
5-5-1.
I'm serious. Humping sheetrock and driving on weekends got to get to you after a while. Might be nice to buy your lady something. All it takes is one fight.
Yeah.
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
No.
A million. Easy.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
Nah.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
Don't be shitty.
I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
Bye.
Fuck him.
Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
It's not even yours.
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
No. Look. There.
How much is it?
How much was it?
Yeah, I guess.
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.
You sold it? I thought they stole it.
Sold it, stole it, whatever...
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?
Yeah. What vibe?
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?
You got that right.
He wants to see us now.
We're getting ahead of ourselves. We haven't gotten any sleep. Let's just keep our mouthes shut and not make any mistakes. Now hurry up and get your shit on so we're not late and make things worse.
Eighty.
Eighty bucks?!?
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
I don't want to take any more chances.
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
Take us right to Kennedy. Now.
I'll be a minute.
Tom. How's it going?
What do you mean 'kinda?'
Excuse me.
He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?
Stop.
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
Coke?
How's it going?
That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
The Soho Grand?
Yeah.
The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.
Don't worry. I get it.
So tell me how it is.
It's a digestif.
Far as she knows you're John Gotti. Now put the shit down and act like you got some ass.
So, you must be the Red Dragon.
And where might that be?
Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.
You better not be. Cause if a cat toe you down in this town, you better stand up or make tracks.
I like you, country.
Bet you are.
Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now.  Baby, what's today?
I'm wearing, Archie.
Now.
What you say?
Man, what do you want?
Don't con me. Don't try...
Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
Read it and keep on reading.
A black man playing big league ball is something.
A Muslim must be strikingly upright. Outstanding. So those in the darkness can see the power of the light.
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
You have enough worries of your own.
The talk is everywhere!
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
What color were the original Hebrews?
Entirely.
Say what you're saying.
If you don't know, man, then I feel sorriest for you.
Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
If she got eyes, she do.
But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
Shorty thought he hit us with 114 years till I explained what concurrently meant. It meant a minimum sentence of 10 years hard labor at the Charlestown State Prison. The date was February 1946. I wasn't quite 21. I had not yet begun to shave.
I ain't stupid.
I mean it's late, baby.
Your control over your children, therefore --
Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
Please make way, please --
You're my father.
C'mere.
You better believe it.
Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size.
It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
That's right.
Head nigger in charge?
Allah will provide.
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
I didn't know then that I was a nigger.
Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death?
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
[Everything on the cellphone. We wait for calls. We have no number to call.]
[Who's the boss?]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[Who ordered it?]
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
[Your brother wants to talk to you.]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
Sorry I woke you, Ray.
I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave that up. Anything else? It's yours.
Well, I let him go.
[Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]
I don't understand.
You think too much?
Then be trained.
I could do it. Remember the day you wanted the pencil? I know why. And I saw that car again. I wrote the license number in my notebook. Except I missed the last number.
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
You're lying. I don't believe you.
Where are you?
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him!
She understands men.
I'm trying, mom.
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
She's young. She'll get over it.
[He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
[He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.]
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
I told you she wasn't attractive...
You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. What do you say? You think I oughta give her a ring? I'll take the skinny one.
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
I'll call her up.
I think this number is a little fast. Wait a minute.
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
You want me to ride down with you?
Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws.
Waddaya getting so sore about?
Come on over about half past seven, we'll think of something.  Hello, Ma, what's the matter?
That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.
Well, he died. You know who else died?
You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
Catherine, my sister...
Were the lights on?
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
I'm having a very good time, too.
That's true. I do. But I'm gonna have to take outta loan inna bank eight thousand dollars. That's a big note to carry, because I have to give Mr. Gazzara a mortgage, and what I have to weigh is: will it pay off in the end more than I can make onna salary?
No...
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
How do you do?
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
Sure.
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
Sure, what?
Sure. Thanks a lot about my mother. We'll work out some arrangement, because naturally I want to pay...
I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll be home in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about something.
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing.
I don't know. I don't think so.
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
Waddaya read there, Joe?
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
On accounta...
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
Okay.
Tommy...
Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?
I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
Home.
Which hospital?
You really think we hurt him that bad?
The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
And it's the ninth inning.
Call Dago Red.
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
An application to Androscoggin College.
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
Yeah, if I can.
Same here. You can retire my number.
When?
We could steal one of the choppers.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
...And for our Supreme Commander over here and our Commander-in-Chief in Washington.
Damn right. Three to one, as much as you want to put up.
You betcher ass, General.
I found a doner.
Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.
Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.
Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. Hey, Radar!
It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.
What do we do?
All of them?
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
Very happily married.
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
Of course not.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
In fact I'd rather not try to influence you at all.  Let's just go in and take a look, and then you think it through for yourself.
Poker sounds great. When do you play?
Tell me the whole story, Walt.
Homosexuality.
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
I wonder, if Red's fix swings it for me, what's heaven really like?
Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.
I – wouldn't – wish – it – on – a – maneating – shark.
I did. First and only blow. So far.
Sir?
Yes, Colonel.
Splendid, sir. No problems.
Damn.
Yeah?
It's a technique Ugly John and I worked out in case something like this came up.
Yeah, maybe.
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
Me?
Yeah, I've heard them a million times, too, but—there you are. Maybe they're like me. Just beginning to get an idea what those things mean.
Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
Yes, sir.
Go ahead, open it, open it.
The Websters.
The Websters!
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
You bet I will, Ma.
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
What's that?
Oh!
A deal?
Sorry.
Right here. Sit down.
Well, maybe you're right.
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Well, what about it?  Let them see him!  We'll go them one better. They can also hear him.  You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
Now, that's crazy. It's fourteen floors!
Sure. Hey, but the biggest thing I didn't tell you . . .
Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.
. . . Tubby?
Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?
Yeah. That's—that's him. Of course, you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, "he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity. Because it'd ruin his self-respect," he says.
What Bert's trying to say is—well—we need you, Mr. Doe. There were a lot of us didn't believe what that man said.
Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
Sure, you are.
Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
Hiyah, John.  John, I want to have a little talk with you.  What's the matter—are you falling? Come here.
They can't, huh?  Who do you think writes 'em? My Aunt Emma? I know she writes them.
Well?
Yes. Sure.
That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!
Better get that story in, Hank, it's getting late.
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there!
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
Flowers.
Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets the flowers.
That's too bad.
And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you?  Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his glove—flopped into a chair—and has taken out his ocarina.
How?
No, sir.
What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week?
Deal.
Don't give up on her. You're getting to the age when you ought to be thinking about these things.
Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.
You got it.
I what?
I have to go face to face.
No. You just do shit for me right now.
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
You'd never been out of New York?
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
I think so.
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
It's against my nature.
Why?
A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.
Still needs work.
About six years. My partner took me.
Pull up alongside.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
That's a chance I gotta take.
I ain't interested in your life story.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
I'm not drunk. Yet.
Maybe you should be.
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
It's very nice.
Scottie...
What?
You let us worry about that.
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
And even if this doesn't work, I want all the money. These SWAT guys don't have the temperament. They don't have the background...
Kimura and Glass will head the investigation.
Yeah, they are but...
Come on!
What do you need?
Yes.
-- If your life's so good up there Gena, what are you doing down here?
Nothing, go back to sleep.
True.  But why?
No.
One would assume so.
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
The truth.
Try harder.
Times Square.
-- You told me.
Once they digitized you, they added it.
What's the difference?
-- Waiter.
Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!
Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin!
I think so.
WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE TOAST!!
LET'S FLY!
If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
You want me to place a few calls?
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
Sir, we do not use such names at our hotel.
You've got the public upset, Al.
Whatever you say, Boss.
I guess I am. Just a little.
He's got a line on the good stuff.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
Shane was a friend of yours?
When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.
Ya mean we're so rich we're broke?
That's it.
We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
I thought we just wanted to be left alone to run our business.
I can just imagine.
I needed to see you again.
You must be feeling better, if you're looking for sex again.
I been thinkin'...
I'll handle the Boss.
It'll just be a few minutes.
Tommy Reina.
Seein' he loved the experience so much, I think we outta give him the pleasure again.
Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
It's only us and Sonny. Hey, Sonny. Come on out.
He's trying to make it.
Boss, I got all the time you need.
Not if they all die at once.
A mother-fuckin' peace conference.
The name's Charlie.
I've got friends.
An' Masseria's got seven hundred.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
The Big Picture.
Wanna know what I think?
Jesus.
Kill them! Kill them!
Anything!
Guess so. Ya got a minute? I got somethin' for ya.
But only on purpose, Tommy.
Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
Stu Miley.
Sad commentary, huh?
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
I got the ring. <i></i> Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night.
Maybe you could talk to Death!
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
<i></i> In what way?
Got a doctor on duty.
It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
Grandmama's ring. The <u>engagement</u> ring. He asked me to send it to him -
This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and... <i></i> I gave the order.
You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
How am I gonna get past the guards?
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
IT'S NOT WORKING.
Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
And you don't deal drugs?
Dating anyone?
But I was dusting.
I don't want to talk about it.
My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people.
I'm sorry.
Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.
Moscow.
Yeah.  Not far.  You will be fine.  It's still day.
Forty-five?  I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
You've never *seen* this contract.
But it *isn't*?
No!
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
Well, why don't they try the police-- get some blood hounds--or Indian guides--
Would you settle for a husband?
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
Now, look, kid--if we're gonna wonder, let's go down and do it over a hunk of steak.  Come on, snap out of it. Diz Moore-- that rarest of companions--is here at your side.  To genteel crime, kid.
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
Tunnel?
We're gonna get married.
I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.
Right now--everything I own--!
Huh?
Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*--
Why me?
Well, then, that's great! And that's a great place to leave it! It's no use *my* barging into this now and--
He's a house-afire!
Kid--he thinks he's talking to that mob at home, but not a line we've written--not a word he's said from that floor has gotten into that home State.
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
What is it?
Can't that wait, Hubert?
Now, now, Emma, dear--you mustn't forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to--
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
We can't help *what* they were! Forget 'em!
Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--
*But you never asked me*!
Himself!
Jeff for Senator.
Look! There it is!
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
I yield.
Yes, I was--
Will he *yield*?
I say it's *your* parade, sir! You've *got* to come!
Well--I'll go to Halifax!
Hello, Ma.  Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
How's Amos, Ma?
You're a liar!
I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--
Convene?
You *couldn't*?
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
How?
I also answer to whistles.
Lena.
You win. It's--Clarissa.
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
No--
Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
Second drawer.
Thanks a lot.
Saunders--!
Wait--
You see--if we could take the poor kids off the streets--out of cities-- a few months in the summer--learn something about Nature and American ideals--
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
Oh--you are!
And how's your bill, Senator?
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill--
Ring the call to quorum.
I know that.
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
You're the best nurse I can think of--
You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
So I go right back where I was-- carrying compromises--covering up-- back to political tricks--this time for--! No! I was just getting rid of all that. If I did *anything*, I ought to go and tell him to stand up and--. No! I don't want any part of it! Smith or anything else! I'm all through. I want to be left alone!
Jim--suppose we didn't try to go through with this Willet Creek Dam-- suppose we postpone it until the next session of Congress--or drop it altogether--
Don't worry about Horace--he'll take orders. Come on--
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
Jim, I won't stand for it.
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
Congressmen, Radner, Schultz, Diggs--
He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until--  Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
Order!  Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Order!
Certainly.
Yes, I—
Who's that?
He sure is.
Any children?
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
No!
And you saw them happen?
That's all, Miss Bennett.
What's that got to do with it?
Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
Oh, I don't mind.
I enjoy it.
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
What did they say?
I say, to most people it's a washout.
What did you mean by that?
You have?
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
Don't be ridiculous.
Why? Why do we have to do it?
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
Marvelous!  "At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'"  Beautiful! What happened after that?
Sure.
With pay!  She is out the door.
You're crazy! You can't do that!
Telling him is the long shot - I'm going to take it.
Shhh!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
He's not home, I tell you!
Let me go!
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
Are you sure this is the town he lives in?
No, we won't! The next time that jumping jack comes out, I'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.
I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
Who - me? No.
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
He and Jim Mason own the Tallow Works. But that's not where he makes his money. He makes most of it from his poetry.
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.
Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
Name your poison and I'll supply it.
Oh, they insisted on following me.
What do you think bodyguards are for?
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to—
We own an opera house, don't we?
But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
What kind of wife did you say she was?
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
No, I mean - about my client.
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
Not at all.
I'm a writer myself, you know.
The difference between them and me is I know when I've been a skunk. You take me to the nearest news- stand and I'll eat a pack of your postcards raw. Raw!
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
Fun?  Say, listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever.  Boy! Boy! My headpiece!
Farmer?
Where is your farm?
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Yes, sir.
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. I'd be arrested.
Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
You try it.
I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
Hmm?
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
Doubtful. What did he say?
He said he wasn't coming back. He said it wasn't working for him any more. That it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while... You know what I regret the most? I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name. He was an acquirer.  He liked to acquire things.
Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
What kind of doubts?
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
What's that?
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
My pleasure.
Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you what that package meant to me --
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
Do you realize how insidious it is to invade the most private thoughts and secret lives of unsuspecting people?...
I'd better get in there.
You like me. How come?
It's a pretty piece of land.
Why do you watch?
-- Go on!
You're right, as usual. See you.
Thanks for your help, Lionel.
Sure.
Martin.
Did you straighten her out?
I think you know what I mean.
No, I really don't.
I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
Hmm.
Even if you don't think it's real?
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
Is she against you getting help?
Something's bothering her.
Oh, we've all disappointed her. Me, especially, but Dad, of course. She thinks my brother's all right, but she didn't expect much. It's what happens when you "marry beneath yourself"...
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
Which thing?
I thought only action movies had villains like that.
Of course.
Hello.
You probably got the idea.
You deserve it.
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
Will you think about it?
No, no... I have three billion dollars.
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.
It's time you did some talkin', Dr. Mum -- Wait a minute. That is your name, isn't it?
It wasn't the best situation.
But look at me now...
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
Why don't I call you when I've got my calendar in front of me?
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?
So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
Even?
Oh, hey, how ya doin'?
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
Intestines.
Do you truly wish to know? Or would you prefer to just shoot us?
Exactly --
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
Correct, And that's when --
For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.
What did you do to him!?
Twenty.
-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
What did you find? What did you see?
The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.
Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.
No. I believe if I can see it and I can touch it, then it's real. That's what I believe.
Because that's my name.
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
No, we are not.
Got what?
I think you found something.
Alright, good, that's good. I like this fellow, like him very much.
I'm your sister.
What's it look like!?
We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
Be nice. That thing saved my life.
And it stinks to high heaven in here.
What?
I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it.
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
What --?
Don't worry, Pootchkie. My womanizing days are over. You're my Lady Macbeth, my Imelda... my Nicole.  We're such an incredible team. Who could possibly stop us? 
Head hunting.
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
Atta, boy!
But you're a superhero.
Me, too.
They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
Get on to yourself!
And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
They always call the great ones nuts.
They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
Really?
Terrific.
It is?
That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.
I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance?
What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
Because that's what it is.
Are you coming or not?
I'll drive.
Not yet.
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.
Who are they?
Whatever our name is.
And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
The point is that I don't think Napoleon will sit in Moscow until the spring!  I don't think he can afford to.
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
If I can presume to go into the Emperor's mind, I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow.  When Vienna fell, there was a peace treaty.  When Berlin fell, another treaty.  That has always been the rules of the game.  But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth- coming?  He knows that beyond Moscow, there is nothing, and that, if he withdraws, there remains only a fall into emptiness.
I shall tell you in the strictest confidence -- when I was a boy, I had a passion for rafts, and never had the opportunity to build one.
Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?
Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
Properly arranged, yes.
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet.  Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
Ah-hh, no.
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
May I suggest that we can prepare and sign the agreement, between ourselves, subject to the approval of the two Emperors.  Believe me, my dear friend, your Archduchess, Marie-Louis, may very well hold, in her hands, the future of our two countries.
Yes, sir.  Are you acquainted with her?
A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
Shall we move closer to the fire?
Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.
Do you have three francs, sir?
Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
Well, you shall see.
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
Ah, that is good.
And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
Five minutes.
Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.
What are you talking about?
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
What?
Yes, I wrote it.
I couldn't face telling you.
You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.
That is correct.
What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
That is a matter of opinion.
My mother has always loved me.  She would do anything for me.
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
What happen?
That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
Black magic.
Cheeco.
Man, Day-Day is my people!
Whatever you say, man.  I didn't see shit.  The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all.
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
You don't know Baby D.
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.
Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
Oh yeah, why you walking?
Hell yeah, I remember you.
Yes I did.  Excuse me.
Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go.  Wife stays here, of course.
I said...are you 'bout it, 'bout it -- rowdy, rowdy?
Peace out, Craig.
Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
Don't worry about it.  We gotta figure out a way to get Craig out of there. He's probably getting tied up now.
Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro. It's Friday.
Yeah, 20 minutes.  Trust me.  I've been pepper sprayed nine times.  20 minutes.
I don't believe this sugar shit. Something ain't right.
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
Nothing.  What you want?
Take your car.
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
I slip my disc, again... Oh got damn.
Oooh, ba-by!
Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl.
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
That's my girl.
I've been a bad boy.
What?
Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
I appreciate that.
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
Same to you.
What about the gun?
Me?
That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
No.
Forget about it.
You don't understand. I'm going to trust you. And you have to trust me.
Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
I'm just an accountant.
Keep it.
Please...
Cover your mouth.
What?
In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
What are you going to do?
Hi.
Yeah.
What!?
I don't know.
Gimme a dollar.
Could I see it?
I've got something for you.
Young love.
Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they?
What gives?
What do you figure he done with it?
That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
I'll bet.
Ain't nobody goin' to neither, long as Uncle Birdie's around.
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
When'll the skiff be ready?
They hid in a broom closet!
She went.
But which one of you can say as I can say: I drove a good man to murder because I kept a-houndin' him for clothes and per-fumes and face paint!
Yes! Yes!
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
Not before one of 'em knifed a farmer and stole his horse. Never caught the gypsies nor the horse.
Come on!
Tricked us!
He's Satan hiding behind the Cross!
John don't like him much.
She talks to herself.
I mind you said there was two.
He ain't my Dad.
Come on, children!
NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
Can I have this?
Ahh!
The first night?
Where's your Missus?
R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
Haven't slept, have you?
You believe in the Boogey Man?
What happens if they don't do that?
Great.
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.
Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.
What?
Sure, but...
I don't mean her --
'Anything funny' like what?
Cause I thought Glen was gonna sneak out to see your lunatic daughter, that's why. So I locked him in his room!  Sorry. Anyways, the door was still locked when we heard the screams.
It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now. 
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
Yes, Mother. G'night.
Nancy?
Put that damned thing down!
Nancy!
They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before.  No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don't feel like it any more.
I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
Right. Well, she didn't, exactly...
Good. No more nightmares for either of us then.
Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
An omelet.
It just goes to prove the theory of our State. If you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you're true to the collective spirit and stick together you've got an omelet.  That reminds me... have you heard the latest they're telling about the Kremlin?
I see.
What do you wear in the morning?
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
Possibly.
They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon?
A telegram from Moscow! It must have been here all day!
Monsieur.
You didn't get legal advice?
That's right.
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
We have opened a restaurant...
Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
Very well, Your Highness.
Good evening, Monsieur.
Yes.
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
If you close your eyes and listen to our voices we might be in Paris.
...Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves... into one single hour you can crowd a thousand and one nights.
Get out of here!
Don't look so gloomy, gentlemen. All is not lost. You may have a chance.
A day.
Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas.
I hope so for your sake.  Let us examine the case. What does the lawyer say?
Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
Yes, it is.
Well, let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...
Yes.
And what do you do for mankind?
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
You repeat yourself.
I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
Wounded? How?
It's false sentimentality.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
So! You want to make a strike breaker out of me! I am surprised at you, Comrade! Is it too much for the workers of the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch? All I can say to you is take your hammer and sickle and get out of that Royal Suite!
Will you smile?
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, "What are your plans for this evening, madame?"
Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.
I promise... I swear.
No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
Comrades! Good people of France!
No. Nobody will find us.
No! No!
No! No!
I know... it's the Russian soul.
Everyone wants to confess and if they don't confess they make them confess. I am a traitor. When I kissed you I betrayed the Russian ideal. Leon, I should be stood up against the wall.
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...
No, no music.
They belong to the people.
Yes, sweetheart. 
Good morning, Swana.
We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
Imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou! Think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages! I can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments!
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Tell him I won't be able to see him for a half an hour.
Darling, you're taking my business affairs far too seriously. Much as I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of their filthy money, I won't do it at the expense of your health. Particularly as we know we won't get much.  You look so pale... pale but interesting.
You saw all that in one glimpse?
A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.  The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
I'm afraid that's what it is.
Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous!  Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.
My dear, you don't know how impressive I could be. Did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels?
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
Yes... leaving immediately.
Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
Then tell Richardson to fire him.
Where the hell is he?
We'll see about that ...
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
It's the fall of the Roman Empire, are you blind?  And we're putting fig leaves on the statues ...
Why me?
Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
No!  Magruder!  That sonofabitch tests my Quaker patience to the breaking point.
We should set up a Cuban defense fund on this; take care of all of them.
Why not?
Well, no place where they speak English.  That way he can always say he was misquoted.
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
Forget it.  Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ...
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.
But he works for the Attorney General. Only Richardson can fire him.
Can we get around this, Al?
And if I stay?
That was civil war.
How do you see this?
That's right ...
It's gone.  No one will ever find out what's on it.
Evidently to install bugs and photograph documents.
It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
Just do what I say, Bob.
Christ, you're right -- Gray makes Jerry Ford look like Mozart.  Just have Helms call him.  Helms can scare anybody.
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
Because the President says it is.  My job is to protect this country from its enemies, and its enemies are inside the walls.
I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.
... an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to become involved in Latin America.  We would lose all our friends in Latin America.
It's okay, Bob, we're just rapping, my friends and I.  We actually agree on a lot of things ...
Let him finish, Bob.
Townsend gave us 300 grand.  Belgium's not worth more than 100, 150 ...
Thou must find thy peace at the center, Richard.  Strength in this life.  Happiness in the next.
Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this.
Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
Mr. Castro.
Would you walk with me down to the paddock?  I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
Remember what Lenin said in 1917, Mr. President: "The power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up."  The Communists have never been closer.  Now is the time to go back to the old themes, the ones that made you president.  Let the Communists know you're onto them.
Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.
They're around.
You're fucking me.
I won't tell him if you won't.
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
Agreed.
Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
No, Henry.  I don't.
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ...
You have many friends ... and admirers ...
Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.
How about Kissinger along with him?
Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.
You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
Sure, I'd like to offer condolences.
Syracuse.
Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
And we got the "big mo"!  We're back!
Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
Yes, yes.
Not that.  Us.
I want a divorce.
That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me.
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
This.  Above all.
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
Because ... I have to relax.
But they never will, Dick.  No matter how many elections you win, they never will.
Tomorrow.
Hiding what?
Whatever it is you've always been hiding.  You're letting it destroy you, Dick.  You won't even ask for help.  You're destroying yourself, Dick.
What matters to me is whether you understand it.
Don't be ridiculous!
Write.  You know, a book.  I'm calling it "Six Crises."  It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write.
No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
I am older.
'Predate it.
I'm... discouraged.
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
Yes.
I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
It's not me he's in trouble with.
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
He can take all comers.
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
He's goin' back out there and he wanted to know if you wanted to go with him.
Don't hurt no one.
Okay.
I mean, would you care to join me.
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
That'll be the day.
At the gettin' place.
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
Promise?
What should I do?
What did you tell him?
She'll be all right?
You mean the nature of this conversation?
Yes I did.
Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
Sir I ain't at liberty to give out no information about our residents.
Is Llewelyn there?
In the truck.  I'll get it.
You from around here?
Do you know where I'm going?
So what're you goin' up there for.
Yeah I'm goin' to bring you somethin' all right. I've decided to make you a special project of mine. You ain't goin' to have to look for me at all.
Sixty-nine cent.
Didn't mean nothin'.
You already asked me that.
Well... I need to see about closin'.
You live in that house behind the store?
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
Yes.
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
What room?
Well enough.
I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed.
You want to change rooms?
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
I got beers in my room.
I do like you.
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
Not any way.
I'm a welder.
Yeah. I was in Nam.
No I don't have it.
He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.
She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
...I meant your food.
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
Oww! My arm, careful!
...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
You better handle what's in this garbage can first.
Yeah?
I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
We think we know where Betty is.
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
...I... I know what you are.
"Thirty-two?"
WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
...what're you saying?
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
...I don't think I know that hospital.
Alright. Oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... Well done.
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
No... what about your sister?
Uh-huh. No, we'll do it later. 'S only a birthday, right? I'll have another one next year...
What?
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
You knew Del?!
I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
What happened when you were twelve?
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
I don't know.
I woulda' been here sooner, but Ballard put me in jail. He still thinks you had Del scalped.
That's horrible!
Really?
I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
Like Rome?
Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived...
To tell you the truth, I can't believe I've made it this far. It may not be Europe, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
No, that should be more than --
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
Really. And where was that, old man?
If we're for real?
A mark, huh?
What 'look'?
What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing...
Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
Worse... you're in Texas.
It's a very moving experience, trust me.
No.
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
You need to remember who you're talking to...
Wesley...
It just didn't fit her profile...
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
Betty was a lovely child.
Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
Hmm... you two in high school together?
You better believe it.
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
No! Let me try this!
I SAID FORGET IT!
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
I swear to God!
Her show?
Huh?
Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
Sales, Mr. McGill, sales! And what do I sell? The Truth! Ever' blessed word of it, from Genesee on down to Revelations! That's right, the word of God, which let me add there is damn good money in during these days of woe and want! Folks're lookin' for answers and Big Dan Teague sells the only book that's got 'em! What do you do - you and your tongue-tied friend?
You can't do this -
What about you, Everett? What'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place?
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
Don't know, Delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. Now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-
And no transmission belt for two weeks neither.
Not that I'm aware.
Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!
Oh, okay.
Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?
Assa good idea, Pappy.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Oh no, no, just the reg'la side -
That's good, honey.
And you were right about that ring. Any other weddin' band would not do. But this-here was foreordained, honey; fate was a-smilin' on me, and ya have to have confidence -
- in the gods - Huh?
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
It was in his bureau.
Million point two.
Isn't it, uh...
Aw, that's all right.
I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
He's a suitor!
What for?
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
Hey, Zackie -- don't go away mad.
Great ass.
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
I don't mean anything by it.
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
Maybe there's hope for you yet.
It's important, sir!
Yes, sir!
No.
Louder!
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
Vietnam?
Let's just wait and see what happens.
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
I haven't made up my mind.
I do.
Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
Seriously.
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
You got no manners and you never tell the truth! You're nothin' special. And if you ask me, you got no chance at all of being an officer!
I know who you are and what you want.
Who says I'm not going after what I want? My mother's thirty-nine years old and she still works in that factory. Every time I see her, I know exactly what I don't want.
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
I know that.
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
I don't know where that is.
He said it's up to us and I got here first, didn't I?
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from.  Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
I don't know... I felt like... like I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... I was so scared... so godddamn scared...
Zack, it wasn't him! He didn't ask me to D.O.R. I came to him on my own.  I'm glad it's over, Zack. I really mean that. He was right. I wasn't doing this for me.
That's right.
Keep your voice down.
They're not supposed to be here!
Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  They shouldn't be here for another week!  They don't own this house yet!
What tables?  I've never seen him before.
I am.  I'm an idiot's son.  An idiot's grandson.  I'm third- generation idiot.  But for once in my life I had a good idea, and I'm not giving up so easy.  You are? Are you actually telling me that for the first time in your life you're gonna throw your cards on the table and go home early?  I can't believe my eyes.  Fourteen million dollars upstairs, Burnham.  You'll be out of the hole. Baby, you'll be so far out of the hole you could draw bricks every night for the next twenty years and still shit green.  Come on, Buddy.  One more hand.
She lied.  Cops woulda been here by now if she called 'em.  Besides, Junior cut the phones.
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
Hey.
No ball, kid.
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
Observe.
This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
Why?
The furniture guy?
478-0150.
I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't know.
What if they get in here?
Shaky?
Huh uh.
Get the fuck out of my house!
Why did the chicken cross the road?
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
What's up?
Sure, those boojie jokers don't do anything except print up a lotta paper saying "Black is Beautiful."
Yeah you do. It's up to you either here or downtown.
Yeah... whatever you say.
I ain't gonna shoot you Judge. Look... it's over. Just run away. Get out. Stay away from Oakland. Cause it's gone... it's gone.
Cy... I ain't even sure.
...no full fledge alliance. But I think we should do a rally with them. Show that there's some common ground between Black and White. You all with that?  All right then Eldridge, set it up.
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
Yes, that's exactly what I mean. And Agent Rodgers?... This conversation never occurred.
So I guess it's safe to say you know about firepower.
Right on Brother Judge...
They were empty...
Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything.
Like the manual says, "Information is...
What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.
If you got something to say, say it.
You got something on your mind... "brother."
Not really. Gimme the keys for the trunk.
Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
Where is he?.
No.
It worked.  How many men can you raise?
You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
Very well, then.
Goodbye.
I will do so as soon as possible.
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
Sir?
Sir.
Difficult, sir.  This is, as you pointed out, a civil war.
I understand, sir.
Thank you.  How's the spotted one's milk?
Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
Poor Richard says they'll make a Declaration of Independence by July.
Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
Yes.
You're in no condition to ride.
It's already over.
If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.
She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
Harry, Harry, Harry...
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
That's five, keep going...
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
Thank you.
Where is he now?
For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
You'll see soon enough, hon.
In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn.
Of course I will.
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
No harm, no foul. But you want to watch out for that road. Those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night.
I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes.  One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one.
I think it is so, Ellie.
For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
This time I mean it.
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half Micmac himself.
Nope. He's your cat now.
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
And Church will be fine.
That's not true. The subject scares me. Because of Zelda.
Elizabeth goes free!
Now, Jack.  That reef is less than a league distant.  It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.
What're you suggesting?
Aye.  See, after you're done with the Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do?  Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue?  The Dauntless a first- rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the seas.  But if you're Captain of the Dauntless, who's left for the Black Pearl?
Or you could surrender.
Then why aren't you eating?
Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
Fetch a hook -- haul him out of there!
Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine!  Go capture him.
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
Commodore, please!
Well, I am not going to stay hidden in some cabin, or I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage!
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
It won't.  It won't, and so we won't.
A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two --
I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
Ah -- he's learned, then.  Plays things more close to the vest. See, Jack was a cartographer, back in Old England.  Somehow he came by the money to commission the Pearl. Hired himself a crew, promised each man an equal share.  So, they're forty days out, and the First Mate says, everything's an equal share, that should mean the location of the island, too.  So Jack gave up the bearings.  That night, there was a mutiny.
How did he get off the island?
We need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines.
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
Smith.
You would do that?
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
Why ask me?
Never.  They took Miss Swann.
I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
I swear, you look just like him.
These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them --
Barbossa.
Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
Yes.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
Like I said, there's no real ship as can match -- Hey!
A moment.
Dr. Bright has escaped.
You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature's going to bury you like she buries everyone else.
Nebbleman.
Consideration?
If you loved me like I loved you?
Poppy, order the trucks from the Gary plant.  And we're going to need a containment crew.
Excellent.  How long until the assembler tank is complete?
I'll do whatever I have to do.
This day just keeps going from bad to worse.
You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
Like Crazy Glue?
So, I guess it worked.
Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.
It already is.
I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
Yeah, we'll see.
You think the chemists that invented Agent Orange twenty years ago were in school saying, 'Boy, I really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant.'  You think Oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war?
All I'm saying is that the companies that have money for the kind of research you're interested in, have money because that's what they're interested in!  Money!
I can't help it, Suze.  It's this place.  You know how I get in these stores.  They freak me out.  All these tiny boxes, little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what.
No, something is really wrong... look!
I don't know.
I'm a plastic man!  A plastic man!
We don't?
What happens?
What?  What's wrong?
The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate.  So what's wrong?
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
Something else I want to try.
No cheese.
Did you think I could just leave you...?
The same thing I suppose.
Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
It's a miracle.
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
Dexter.
Goodbye, Stew—
Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.
Certainly. Right over there.
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
Sure, I'll take a chance.
For the letters, of course.
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and — 
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
Of course I am Stewart.
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live—
Sure - my pal on the paper. She's subbing for the society editor tonight.
Gallagher?
Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.
That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do.
All right, I'm a child. Have it any way you want. But I'm going back to my own apartment, where I should have lived in the first place. But no, I got to listen to you and move here. All right. If you want to live with me, Anne, okay. But the sign outside will say "Mr. Stew Smith" and you'll have to be "Mrs. Stew Smith" or there's nothing doing. No more Anne Schuyler's husband—He has his bag all packed by this time. He snaps it shut viciously, lifts it off the chair, picks up his hat, and notices Mrs. Schuyler staring open-mouthed at him.  —and here's some more news for you. You can take your red room, your green room, your left wing and your right wing, and you know what you can do with them!  Come on, Gallagher.
I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
Mother!
Well, I should say!
That's what I wanted to say, but I couldn't think of it.
I certainly will.
Hey, make up your mind, will you?
You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
Not on my own beat, no.
A what?
I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath?
Your valet, sir.
Oh no, sir!
I beg your pardon, sir?
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
Yes sir!
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
I hope not . . . I've got to call on her this morning!
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
There you are—!
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Did Conrad draw on his imagination?
It'll be ready in a minute.
Sorry, boss—
There's nothing sudden about that—  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.
We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
Thanks. May I sit down?
You don't.
I beg your pardon.
And now for that twentieth crack—
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
I understand, sir.
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
I just putter.
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.
Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
It can't be possible.
It's alright.
Oh, George ...
Really Biff? The keenest?
Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Hunh?  Oh, right ...
... Lover's Lane.
Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you want to.
What's the matter?
Oh, no thanks ...
No. Of course not.
Real rain?
Yes I do.
What do you mean!?
Hello Mr. Simpson.
No, not that hedge. The other one.
Yeah. Every episode ever.
What happened?
You--you gotta get us out of here.
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
I don't think so.
One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you?  You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
What?
And you're sure about this?
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
Oh ... Right.
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
What's that like?
They just grow like that?
Rain.
I'm not sure.
Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's Department store" ... "Their father dressed as Prince Charming." That was gorgeous Bud.
But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
... Hi.
Well c'mere, young fella.
Why don't you just take me back without it?
Yeah ...
But you didn't come so I kept on wiping.
I understand.
... Yeah.
Yes.
You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
Oh ... Okay.  ... But I really liked it.
Yeah.
I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...
Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
Somewhere in Utah.
D&D Mattress Man.
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
I'm trying to be your friend.
No.
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
What?
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
You're being weird again, see. Come on. Please don't be weird.
Why's it here?
Call me later.
Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
I....please don't do this.
Hi. This is Jack.
...just talking to you....
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
...yes...
...yeah.....
Ok. SEXY VOICE Yeah...that's it...God I Am So Horny...I wish I was there to help you.....I wish I was there for you, Barry.
I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?
You don't even know how much it is.
Really? Please?
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
Yeah.
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
-- well, if you're gonna go --
I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.
So that was your pudding?
Nothing.
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
Really?
Have a good trip.
Thank you.
Yeah.
I thought that you were anyway.
If you give me six to eight weeks I can redeem the mileage and then I can with you wherever you have to travel......
Did you do it?
Well who did?
......and this is confidential?
What do you mean?
And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?
And your name?
I haven't even told you what's happened. Your girl that you have that works there for you threatened me and two men just chased me -- extorted money -- DEAN Go fuck yourself that shit doesn't have anything to do with me - this is a legitimate bossiness.
I'll say whatever I want --
You came all the way from Los Angeles to tell me that?
Thank you.
I don't like the way I am sometimes.  Can you help me? WALTER Barry, I'm a dentist, what kind of help do you think I can give you?
That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.
So what should I do with the pudding?
....I made a call.....  ....and, uh....
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
Ok.
Alright: And I have to go and buy some more pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I'm realizing it sounds a little strange but it's not. So can you come and help me out?
Hi.
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
I won't.
You can't be late though.
I know.
I thought Latisha said you would --
It's....whatever....that's not cool.
I'm only paying two of you guys.
What's the problem?
Put him through.
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
It's not bad, it's ok.
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" --
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
How can one man possibly be so selfish?
Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
NOW STRIP.
Your wig. Remove your wig.
Your words drove Bouchon to --
-- that was lust --
I know, because I felt it myself --
This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
You're a sentimental man.
No. It most certainly was not.
Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum.
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves --
I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delbenè; I look to the future.
I'll pay you another visit, with a share of the profits, once its sold.
"The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."
Yes?
"Well worth the dig!"
Go ahead; you've a key. Slip it through my tiny hole...
You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
Is it terribly erotic?
Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
You demand a lot from your readers, you do.
First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it.
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
What thought is that?
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
Last week would this be?
Houdini mice.
And director.
Randolph!
You know that can't happen.
Why is that, Louis?
There certainly is I There certainly is! Aw, to hell with you!
You are slovenly and unattractive and I won't  t-t-t-tolerate it.
I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
Good. Retain that feeling. Let it nourish you from this day forth. It shall nourish us both
Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today.
Forget it-
I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
Mank-
Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why, boy-o?   Power.   Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.
We're doing Hearst.
Fuck you
How does it feel, Mank? Going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table? How does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves--?!
I don't have it anymore?!
It doesn't have to be
How?
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
Well, at least she's off KANE today
So they're Jews. . .
Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake--
Surely My pleasure, Miss Davies..
You're going to destroy it
Again.
Jesus
"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
Without me. I'm afraid. I got the axe this morning.
Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
Just come by to wish you luck.  Need anything?
Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
No, I can't wait. You know when I wait? When it's important to wait. It's not important to wait for no steak. It's important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't important to wait for no steak! I won that fight. So, I stayed in the ring, and that way I made sure everybody knew it. I shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
And where you goin'?
Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
Nothing...
I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
Go 'head.
Nah, not now... I wanna wait. I don't feel right...
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
With her? How?
I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to win. I've done a lot of bad things. I dunno...
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
Where you been?
What?
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
So what?
I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.
Why should I be bitter? Boxing's been good to me. I got a nice house, three kids, a beautiful wife -- take a picture of her. Vickie.
Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now? You wanna go for a ride?
Just keep your eye on the ball.
Can you see it?
No.
You said never to touch you before a fight.
Come here.
I was just...
You asleep?
What did I do?
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
"Father of the Bride."
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
I am answering...
With Salvy, eh?
I went with Sandy and Vera. Salvy was there.  Stop it. I just had a drink, that's all. I didn't do anything wrong. 
You did?
Why don't you just call him?
Sure, what else is new?
Can't you get the money from your friends?
What friends?
Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
Oh. When are they expected home?
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
Not yet.
The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
Jeff -- huh?
You think he's getting out of here?
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
For what?
With that cast on -- you don't.
Like what?
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
Yeah.
Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.
That's the hard part.
She pay you much?
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
I was.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
You called the police?
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
There's no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book, Lisa.
That'll get her out of there, won't it?
Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
-- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
Going on right here. It's a big night.
Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the "21" for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward -- we're trying to get his next show.  Then I had to dash back and change.
For yourself -- and me.  I could get you a dozen assignments tomorrow... fashion, portraits --
There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
Of course not.
I have one now.
Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --
Someone not his wife?
Inside stuff?
I do?
Thank you.
Give me some dirt.
How 'bout you?  Say the word and you're cold, Jack--you're dead.
Jim Stark.
No--
No.  We're going to bring him down.
Then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
Well, now--
Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad?
I was in it.
You're absolutely right!
No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
I was talking to Jim.
He's home.  I heard the car.
Look--can't you see I'm writing?
I don't want to make friends.
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you.
Judy.
I'm what?  What?
Who?
Why?
Keep away from me!  I don't believe you anymore!
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
That's a fine way to behave!
No.
I don't know why--!
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
They never do.
I bet you see right through me, don't you?
You serious?
You don't have to be unfriendly.
Goodbye!  See you!
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
You decide, darling.  Remember our budget.
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
Are you?
He needed you, maybe.  So do I.
Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
I did?  Well, he might as well be dead.  What's the difference?
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
No.
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
Daddy--
Read a lot about you, Nick.
Please, Gabriel, don't...
YES!!!
And you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!
...whoever she is.
Searching for a money man...
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
Thank you.
Tell me again.
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
Nick...
What's going ON!!!
Nick, no --
No, Nick, no --
Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this!
Jack. Jack Bangs.
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
You shouldn't have.
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
Yes!
So you could get down her chimney.
Yes!
Bam Bam.
Hey.
The hell you don't.
We got faith in you, Nick Mason.  You're our inside man.
Might as well be.
Get out.
I'm no threat without a gun.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys.
What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
How'd you know my name...
And where they hide the real money.
Show's over.
He's not Nick Mason...
The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
We're all outta gifts, boys and girls, but we got charitable donations!
Acid-chewer.
That right? Shit. I used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. Shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. You ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue?
Somebody better give me something with some goddamn bacon --
I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
How do we do that?
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
Ain't there yet.
I'm just saying.
No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
Shoulda written, Rudy...
Five years, Nicky. Five years.  I just want to go home.
YOU TELL HER!
You gave them me.
That was my king!
I'm ninety-two years old --
How do you know all this?
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
The things you gotta remember are the details. It's the details that sell your story. Now this story takes place in this men's room. So you gotta know the details about this men's room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you.
Mr. Brown?
Sure.
How is he?
Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.
Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl.
Why am I Mr. Pink?
She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
You don't know jack shit. I do. This rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.
I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.
What're you talkin' about?
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
Down to my car.
It's a surprise.
Correct.
You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.
When I was coming down here, I was playin' it. And "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on. Now I ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, I heard it a million-trillion times. I'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time I ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed Andy.
I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job.
You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
As opposed to good?
I'm cool.
Why not?
You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?
At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.
You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
He scared the fuckin' shit outta me. I thought he was dead fer sure.
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
He asked.
If I have to tell you again to back off, me an you are gonna go round and round.
That fuckin did it!
This place just ain't secure anymore. We're leaving, and you should go with us.
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
You takin' his side?
Yeah, those guys too.
Maybe he did.
I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
And one of 'em is sick.
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
Like sticking his nose into other people's business.
He's learning his letters.
It's a long walk back to Aspen.
But the rest is right.
Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.
Like I said, I was thinkin' of the horses.
Goodbye, Mary.
A fellow sees a fire go out all of a sudden, he don't take chances. My name's Clayton and I'm looking for someone.
You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
Yeah, it does.
I just wondered. Let's go.
What's there to be fair about?
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
But I want to stay.
Darling -- now I've got you all upset.
Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
I like it.
Plenty more.  And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it.
Maybe in Sonora.
We don't want to go there.
Stop it --
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
How about California?
Now I know what a unicorn is, what do we do next?
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Hugh Kane.
That we should take our friendship a little further?
Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.
Actually, I was going to say let me have your computer if you die.
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
Let's get a hot dog.
Come on. We better get you cleaned up.
It's the sequel.
Oh, right.
This can't be happening?
We have to destroy him.
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
That's where my best customers are. Marion Berry, George Bush, the Redskins. I'd like to offer you a job, Cindy. Can you type? Take dictation? Swallow balloons filled with cocaine?
Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.
I wouldn't go that far.
Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this.
Right. What about condoms?
Hi.
I guess so.
Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.
Me? Grace? Okay -- Dear God --
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
"Fucked me."
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.
0h, shit!
No more violence... No more violence...
Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
Aw, Mom! I hate Mr. Stubbins!
He certainly drives like a jerk.
Keep the change, you son of a psycho!
She sure can pick 'em!
Let me see!
CHIP! You know how much I hate the brown word!
God, Mom!  What's the matter?
Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
That's right.
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
You mean for TV or print?
Bird books mostly...
Nice?! He should have been executed!
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
Oooohhhh.
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
Are those pussy-willows?
What do you mean, you're not sure?!
Watch the booth! I'll be back! 
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
It's the least I could do.  I heard shouting.
We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
Yes, ma'am, it is.
Yeah —- sure.
Okay, Mr. Radeau, it's forgot.
I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
 I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
As a man, you distrust me —- perhaps you believe me as a physician.
She could use a hundred dollars.
How's Miss Jacqueline?
Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
What does she do with herself after business hours?
The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things ——frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging -— waiting —— I feel as if I'd never known her.
Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact -— I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her —— to see her —— to touch her —— in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -—
Well, I'm glad you came to see me.
What things? Why?
Yes.
I know —— I shouldn't have told you—
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but it doesn't make good sense.
Not from me.
Why wait?
I don't know.
Yes.
I want you to look for Jacqueline.
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
Some time before those nice white gloves are dry you're going to go and find out a few things about Mrs. Redi.
Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
What's wrong, Mary?
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything —— and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
What a peculiar question.
I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
I don't know.
One believes -— it's like any other religion...
Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --
I haven't said anything of the sort.
It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
I'll be out in a minute.
I had to help get rid of the body. You saw it on the subway. And I warn you, Mary -- go back -- you don't know what you're doing, or what dreadful things you might bring about by looking for your sister. You go back to school - - go back and forget Jacqueline.
Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.
Oh, no problem. It can wait.
No. Why?
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
How long has it been since you've seen John?
Nine years.
Sister older or younger?
What's the first?
It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
Well... are you self-conscious about it?
My therapist said that --
I can see that. What are they?
Not really.
Yes, I do.
I know.
Then do it.
How come?
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
Don't you get lonely?
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
But I don't understand --
Yes.
You mean you're still in contact with her?
But you're planning to be?
But that was part of it?
Why not?
I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting --
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
Yes.
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
What upsets you about that?
This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?
What do you mean, like physically?
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
I guess.
Yes.
Because all she thinks about are these guys she's after and I just hate her she's such a little slut I thought that in high school and I think that now. Why do people have to be so obsessed with sex all what's the big damn deal? I mean, it's okay and everything, but I don't understand when people let it control them, control their lives, why do they do that?
I know, but this... I just feel like everybody I know right now is obsessed with sex.
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
I feel like I do.
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
It's a sun dress.
Nope.
Why don't you let me tape you?
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
That's all.
Yes.
How do we start?
Yes.
What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
Do you like the way I look?
You are scum. I'll be there.
That you... you don't even know the guy.
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
How about straightening up the living room?
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
How about for five hundred?
She held up very well.
What do you mean?
I see. Then what brought you up here?
Medical clinic?
I won't be at the office except to sign in.  I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and more garages.  I'll come home right after work.
I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
I don't get it.
No? How come?
Yeah? What do I do then?
BREAKING OUT
Good!  I'm gonna be there.
It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Everything's free there.
Now Betty, don't overreact.
Faith, Betty.  But make sure it's your own.
We've got to, Brad, everyone's watching.
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
I know.
Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
Flavors!
We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.
OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
Just seeing how you're doing. And, um, Mom and I were starting to look over the seating charts again, and we're wondering if you wanted Tony Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, or should he be at one of the singles tables?
I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
Bottle.
They're just leftovers.
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
No, I'm an actor.
No, we're paying for the wine.
That's a 1992 Byron. It's really rare. Don't open it now. I've been saving it!
Sure is tasty.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
Oh yeah. Much better.
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
Um... seventy... something.
Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
And get your bone smooched.
I owe her a call anyway.
Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
Yeah, that would be a good move.
Just a minute!
You know that chick?
She is very hot.
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
She works for tips!
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
Yeah. Okay.
Understanding of what?
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy.  This is our day!
Nope.
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
Nope.
Abattoir. Huh. But you are going to get the good news this week about your book. I know you are. I can feel it.
What exactly are we going to do?
No.
I don't have to.
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
Keep it elevated.
I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
I'll pay for it.
Yeah.
I know. I love that.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
Yeah? Like what?
Good. So did I.
You too.
Oh, Maya. No.
That's great.
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
Both.
Then buy a bottle and go outside.
Exactement!
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
I saw a monster. Can I have a glass of water?
This one?
You don't mean it. It's just for show.
No I'm not.
I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?
I got him.
What are you doing?
Me too.
Don't.
Yes.
Don't do it.
Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.
What's two?
What's that?
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
You take care of yourself...  Graham.
You'll lose the signal!
They'll find a way in.
Posse? What the hell you talking about?
Wait a minute! If you don't believe me, ask them...  ...they saw me and my pal in Turley before we did the job.
No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
What friend is that?
Your next water ain't for three days.
Chicago. Working in the slaughter- houses.
Yeah... maybe. So long.
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
Just like you'd think. But he's not going to run. We're sticking to our plan. Now we both need help.
I already did that.
All right. I'm looking for a young fella, full of juice. About my size, wears a fancy two-gun rig.
Right... I thought they always did it at dawn.  So long, kid. I'm sorry.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
Gotta meet a guy and head out for Silverado.
Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
What about the law?
We didn't get that far.
Blind Pete taught me a great trick.
Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
Give the man a line of credit. He already owes the house thirteen bucks.
Is that a fact?
Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.
It's none of your business.
Good luck, Mal.
What about his brother?
It's been a while.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
What's she got to do with it?
I run the place. What can I get you?
You like a good saloon?
Why'd you go into business with him?
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
I'm ready for that.
That was my plan.
Oh, yeah, you two are going to get along fine. You got a lot in common.
Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
Who?
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
Good-bye.
Excuse us.
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
The picture's dead.
Even if you find her, you know the problem with unknowns, Viktor.  If they're good, they get known.  And then you're back to sorting their candy... and worse.  I'm sorry, Viktor.
Viktor, it's my studio.
I'll send you her resume.
What about it?
Simone does not control my destiny.
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
Soon.  Soon.
No.
Well, yes.  From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single.  Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent, well informed, a natural.  And touching. She was spectacular.
Not if I don't let her.
-- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back.
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
Just a minute.
No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky.  How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
I'm not even sure I deserve it. After tonight I'll have almost as much screen time on your show as I do in my movies.  How is that healthy for a performer?
I'm sure she's meeting with a lot of people right now.  She is just as you described her, Viktor... indescribable.  I strongly sensed she thought I was right for it.
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
I have to talk to her about my experimental film.  It's very... experimental.
I have your new leading lady...  ... right here in my pants.
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
I've seen them all before.
That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
She can't watch herself.
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
You understood them.  That's what was amazing.  It's a nice day.  Let's eat outside.
-- I know, I don't know anything.
It's from both of us.  Of course you'll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit --
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
What?!
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
She looks a lot like you.
Whatever it is, it's dark.
Dark?
Long live the First Amendment.
You're in breach.
It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
Taller, Viktor.
What if it catches on fire?
You're right.  You're right.  Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well, I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us.
Dr. Crowe.
Know what?
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
Yes.
Why don't you think about it for a while?
Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.
What happened?
Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
A lady. She died.
Yes.
Ghosts.
You think I'm a freak?
She wanted me to tell you, she saw you dance.
Stop looking at me.
Stuttering--
J. C. Penny's?
Let's say today, we make it your business.
Two.. maybe three days.
Slut.
Witch.
Tramp.
The band.
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next.
Wrong. Fratricide is when you gun down your brother. You're out. My turn.
-- "Billy-Jean" --
This is his room... isn't it?
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
I --
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.
Not at all. They lynched my ancestors, they smell like manure, they have sex with their relatives... and they all have two first names: "Bobby- Joe" --
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
Still trying to figure it out myself.
I said that's enough!
No --
Don't look.
Never.
What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
Like your guitar break.
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
Yeah. Good.
Do it.
Shut up.
Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
That's not true -- Where are you--?
Okay.
I loved you. I loved --
You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck.
I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
An existentialist.
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
Yeah.
I know.  Bandit two, bring yourself on in.
And?
Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.
I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
See.
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
Two is one.  Listen, let's just stay on the odd channels and switch everytime. Start in the basement. Now, let's haul ass.
Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
Redneck heaven.
Tell him we'll be back on the highway in a second.
She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.
I'm at marker eight-five.
I ran into complications.
We're gone.
Nope. Just keep those wheels churning.
It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
Don't take that foot off the hammer, 'cause you got wall-to-wall Bears about to pour over you like maple syrup.
Yeah, but...
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.
Seventy-two five.  Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
About one to five years worth.
That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
Yes, ma'am.
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
So there are no guests staying on that floor?
Is your security team armed?
Of course. Yes.
Yeah, but the Untouchables took down Capone. Heller got shot and killed. The bad guys beat him. Worse, Sparazza walked.
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
Yeah, why.
...About what?
Jack, if the rumors hold and Israel is really the great white whale of snitches, then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that. So what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace, when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom.
Your attitude sucks.
I been accused of worse.  What do we got...?
I left him a message.
I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want!  Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard-ons about it -- make it Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides --
They what? What? No. No. Why?
The Deputy Director, this prick Locke, he smashed the whole thing, we're done, they won't tell me why...
Difficult to explain everything now...  And much larger issues loom.  I'm sorry about Carruthers... Damndest thing to have to die for.
We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas, time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days.
-- he's doing it then, huh --
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
So what I heard downstairs there is that they got a guy, some Swede, real badass, supposedly a "specialist" and they're bringing him over. Now he ain't coming cheap -- so, I'm thinkin' we jump, do this in the next day or so, get to Israel before the Swede can, we got chits, y'see? We're in a power position. Grab him, ransom him back, pick up that nut, we're that much closer to having our own thing.
Yeah... Sid?
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
It's going around ain't it? Mafuckas catching bullets like the common cold up in this bitch.  I think I accidentally shot and killed my boy today.
Wait, I'm getting some fucked up feedback off that earpiece --
I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new.
Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...
What's the time frame?
What do you want?
It can.  Ordinary matter, like ours? Not affected.  Everything else, disintegrates.
And you're not?  Maybe you're my puppet.  But like all puppets, you think you're actually human.  It's The Puppet's Dream.  Wondering if they're human!
We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him.
What?
Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
Told you what?
What is it?
Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
Oh, this one you love?  What about the first one, the one you fucked and then put into a rocket and blasted into space?  You didn't love her?
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
You do, you don't.  She's willing to give her life, you're willing to give yours, it's touching and magnificent, anything you want but -- this isn't the place for it.  Don't you see?  No, you don't.
I'll just be a minute.
Why?
I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
You talk like an actor.
Then it's God, right?
Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
Yes.  Yes.
Stop.
Why did she do it?
I love you.
Thank you.
Neither did I.
I never said I didn't.
I want you here.
You exist here.  I keep telling you.
It's an experiment.
And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek.
I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
Right.  That's true.
Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home.
My father founded a music school there.  The Milton Gregory School.
Sooner, the better.
Big talk... Desperate guy.
You were reading my Renoir.
How did you know?
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
Absolutely.  Look at this.
Sleep good.
Open the door, will you?
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park.
This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
Listen, you're right.  Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay?
Let's do it.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
Just putting in an appearance then.
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
Too kinky.
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
You got a great ass!  I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
Unbelievably handsome.  You look fantastic in a suit.
I'd identify him.
I might stop you.
It's not your taste.
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
I just sat and listened.
When I want your advise, Keegan, I'll make an appointment.
What about when she identifies him?!
Right behind you, T.J.
Do it, or look for another profession.  That's a choice I guess.
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
No, I will not step outside.
You should'a brought the girl.
Why should she come in?
Put him under the table or I'll stop her from coming in.
Scrambled eggs surprise?
Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere!  I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things.
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
See?
They'll never take me alive.
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
Harry…
And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.
You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
You make your own luck, Parker! Get into the middle of things, spend every day pounding the pavement of the city's mean streets--
Yeah--
Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
Frmpph-yrr.
Fine.
Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
Well...
When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
Uh is a good start.
Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change.
That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
Do you mind if I come too?
I... I like you.  A lot.
Oh, Peter. A zit.
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
Doubtless.  And you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work.   Somewhere else.
Actually, I got this spider bite…
Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
Luck.  The right place at the right time.
I asked if you felt like a drink--
I just gave-- yeah, sure.
Imagine how I feel.
Plenty.
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
So long, Sefton.
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
That's right.
You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.
Take it.
What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
What are the chances busting out of here?
I'm okay here. Why bother?
How could I have had a time bomb? They searched me when they took me prisoner.
They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
Jawohl.
You always think I am a square. I have been to America.  I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!
Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
Why do you do this to me every morning?
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
What's the award?
Let go, Animal! It's chow! We'll miss chow!
Come on, baby! Daddy's going to buy you a hunk of cheese!
You clocked him! Why don't I clock you?
So what? There's other women!
You're crying, Animal.
You have a Lieutenant here...
Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
The guy I want to talk to is Sefton. Where's Sefton?  You haven't seen Sefton, have you?
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
Right.
Who did?
Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
You can tell Father Murray to --
Where. Up Joey's ocarina. Didn't you know?
Six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland.  Am I boring you, boys?
You are trying to say that an American would inform on other Americans?
How many do you want? A thousand?
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
That is my wife.
Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?
Twelve years, sir.
Yes, well, congratulations, Ensign. It wouldn't be the Enterprise without a Sulu at the helm.
Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
Signal the closest starship. We're in no condition to mount a rescue. We don't even have a full crew aboard.
Beam them directly to Sickbay.
You're in the Nexus.
You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
I don't need to be lectured by you. I was out saving the galaxy when your grandfather was still in diapers. And frankly, I think the galaxy owes me one  I was like you once- so worried about duty and obligations that I couldn't see anything past this uniform. And in the end, what did it get me? Nothing. Not this time.
Close to retirement?
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
Yes.  Thank you.
When I retired, I swore I'd never set foot on a starship again, and I meant it.
Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
I was ordered to by the Captain.
I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.
Aye, aye, sir.  Take the wheel, Commander.
Understood. That will be all.
How is that possible?
You may still. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
Put me on the hailing frequency.
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
Response?
Could be Grissom.  Patch in the hailing frequency.  U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please.
I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
But... How could they have evolved so quickly...?
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
Well, all the same, I'm going to advise Starfleet and get instructions.
Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
Scan for vessels in pursuit!
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
You would have done the same for me.
You saved the ship, Spock. You saved us all. Don't you remember?!
Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
... A cloaking device?
Go, Sulu!
Oh, I'll have "Mr. Adventure" eating out of my hand. And I'll see you at the rendezvous.  All my hopes.
Yours...?!
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.

No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
Yes...
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
But sir! Federation Starship approaching.
<U>We are Klingons</U>! Once you control the ship, I will transfer my flag there. And we will take Genesis from their own memory banks!
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
All true.
Would you like to tell me whose are the <u>right</u> hands, my cold-blooded friend? Are you in favor of these experiments?
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
From yourself, Admiral.
I can spare me...
Something Spock was trying to tell me. On my birthday.
Ssssh!
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...
<u>This is Ceti Alpha V</u>! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste. <u>Admiral</u> Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails.
You realize, sir, that they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order.
We appear to have plenty of time.
We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!
Visual --
Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
Picture, Mr. Saavik.
Spock?
Admiral --
We'll beam aboard. Alert transporter room --
All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
I see. Well, shall we start with the engine room?
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
I would not presume to debate you.
The tape was made a year ago. I can only assume they've reached Phase Two by now --
It would explain a great many things --
Wait for my signal, Spock -- too soon and he'll have time to figure it out and raise them again.
Affirmative, Admiral.
Best we could do in two hours.
Uhura, if you don't hear from us, there won't be anybody behind. Kirk out.  You gentleman can remain here, or...
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
We learn by doing, Lieutenant.
The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir.
All stop, sir.
Distance from Reliant...
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
... Now entering the Neutral Zone...
Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission...
He's very human.
By the book...
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
Where must you go?
Humans make illogical decisions...
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
It'll come back to him.
Dammit, Jim, they've made him into a goddam green-blooded computer!
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
Well nobody's perfect...
It is.
We're just -- observing.
Can you isolate the wave?
Depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor.
Like who you really are and what you're doing here and what this thing is.
I am? May I go now?
Why's that?
The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales...
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
... You're very perceptive.
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
Let's just say that no humpback born in captivity has ever survived.  Problem is, they won't be a whole lot safer at sea because of all the hunting this time of year... So that, as they say, is that.  Damn.
... Who are you?
That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
Calm yourself, Nurse.  Scotty, get us out of here!
He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
Uhura. Get me through to Starfleet Command.
You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
I cannot tell a lie.
<u>You?</u>  Spock, that's extraordinary.
Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
Three-one-zero, aye!
Aye, sir!
Right.  Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.
About 60 feet, Admiral.
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
I'll have to re-energize.
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
On my way...!
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
I demand to see the owners! I demand --
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
That's the ticket, laddie.
Old, yes. But interesting.  Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
They are my friends.
Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
A perfect moment?
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
You've brought the Federation into the middle of a blood feud, Admiral. The children have returned to expel their elders... just as they were once expelled. Except Ru'afo's need for revenge has now escalated to parricide.
I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
Bye.
Captain, Geordi...?
Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
It is over.
Good luck. Dougherty out.
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.
I'm sure. Just don't forget what they did to us.  We'll have them rounded up in a day or two... we needn't bother with the Federation holo-ship any more. Just get the holding cells ready.
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat...
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
Remind me to lodge a protest...
We're through running from these bastards.
Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
Deck ten.
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
Sir?
Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one...
No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
Transferring controls to manual.
You have two days to become experts... Mister Worf, your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture Data.
But it's comfortable.
You're in quite a mood today.
Absolutely.
Good hunting. Hayes out.
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
We have two... but we don't have the juice to run them.
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
Where's the Sphere?
I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
Not very well. We met shortly after the Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most... promising officer.
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
There should be an access hatch nearby...
I have the password right here.
There should be some kind of manual release...
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
Always am.
She's a very... determined woman.  Phoenix to control. Mister Lange... let her in.
California. San Francisco.
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
Don't flatter yourself. I take pictures of a lot of junk.
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
Fire.
Intercept course, full impulse.  Weapons status?
Go to manual.
Just a little queasy...
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
What are you suggesting?
There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
We DO sleep lying down.
Can you - ?
Speak for yourself. One day... one night...
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
No way.  You see this?
Spock's looking for us...
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
Ah. I believe you also consumed Romulan ale at the officers' mess on the night of question, Doctor?
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
I beg your pardon?
That, either as an instrument of Federation policy or acting on your own drunken initiative, you and your fellow conspirators crippled KRONOS One and cold-bloodedly assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council. Then you and Doctor McCoy went aboard to make certain the job was complete.
Those words WERE spoken by me.
For insubordination.
Uhura, monitor!
Who else?
Second star to the right - and straight on till morning...
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
There's a reward for your death.
Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
Kronos, sir?
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
They're dying.
Congratulations, Lieutenant. That must make you very proud...
Spock, I'm really tired...
I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was...
But I am not human. I am only -
Make ourselves a target?
I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
Such things have happened before, sir.
An omission. After that -
Visual!
Essential as a resource. Praxis is their key energy production facility.  Send to Klingon High Command: "This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship traveling through Beta Quadrant. We have monitored a large explosion in your sector. Do <u>you require assistance</u>?"
Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
I think  not.
And if they're still in place?
How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?
He's placing himself in a most awkward position...
Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
Why?
I do not understand.
No. Can I move now?
No. I must deactivate you.
He was a bit proud as I recall.
Is he very much like you were?
That was another time.
I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
Of you?
How can you be sure?
You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
Emergency force fields are holding.

As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me!
Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
Counselor?
Make it so.
When this is over, I owe you a drink.
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
What programs were accessed?
As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties.
He wants to look me in the eye.
We’ve got him!
On screen.
Just lucky, Admiral.
On screen.
Sir --
It's working.
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
Praetor Shinzon?
I've never met a human woman.
Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.
Not so long.
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
Runs in the family.
My time. I'll spend it how I choose.
Seven minutes.
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
Praetor.
Probably kids.
No.
He's got a gun!!
Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
When can we expect containment?
It's in a green Mustang?
Is that what's affecting your performance?
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
No.
Yes.
You want to try it?
You didn't even see it.
Then let me go. You don't need me.
A baby is a new person?
Eh... yes...
Why?
What is hitchhike?
That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
The driver will...
Yes.
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
Yes.
It's a kiss...  Goodbye...
It was a mistake.
He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.
Are you my friend?
Don't be afraid... I'd really like to hear it.
But I have never seen this before. I am not complete.
You can have one.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
We're hundreds of miles from where you have to be.
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
You're damn right I am.
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
What for?
I know how to gamble now.
I'd like to...
No, thank you.
I must go.
You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.'
I will.
My grandmother's rich.
Slow down, slow down.
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
Doesn't make sense.
You have no conception of this, do you?
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
The police think he was high on drugs...
Parlez vous Francais?... Habla Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?
Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the funeral.
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
Hey... he didn't look like no big time criminal to me.
Hold on a minute... Let's take the chance, George.
Leave him alone, Tran.
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.
Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
Watch and see.
Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
Tonight.
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
No.  Mace is in this.
Exactly anything.  Whatever you want.  Whoever you want to be.  Fabri, get us another round, would you.
Hey, Iris, you okay?
Let's work it.
You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!
Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
I won't say anything.
Sorry.
So lay it off to somebody else.
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
Faith, can I talk to you a second?
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
She's my destiny.
Wants to share.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.
Uh unh.  I won't do it.
It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
No.  Trust me.
Then we'll be right where we are now.
Right.  That explains it.
Aw, Mom!
Testa?
Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
You tell me.
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
You heard?
Her body turned up. In a Minnesota cemetery. They brought her back.
I'm sorry. This won't take long.
We need to run this through VICAP, search for similar burns.
I appreciate it, doctor. You know how it is, press screaming for answers, Washington's all over me.  Ever handle a serial case?
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
You're a... you're sick.
What kind?
Smarter than us.
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
I'm hesitant to...
I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
The Academy, then CIIAC.
Why did he come out here? What's going on?
Doesn't fit.
What's this country coming to?
What did you tell him?
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
I'm in Omaha. Get to the airport. There's been another one.
And you're working with him?
They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer.  I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer.
Low calls him Suspect Zero.
The little piggie speaks.
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.
And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.
I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
Maybe you should back off.
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
Yeah.
Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel.
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
[Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
I want to go live with you.
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.
Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this.
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
Thank you, Nikki.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Yes. Like the quiche.
Not lately.
Just like that?
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
What what? What advantages?
Oh. You know.
What else is going on?
He is so sweet.
Could you believe it?
Sure, that'll be fine.
Who's your booking agent?
Well, who represents you back east?
Yeah. And an actor.
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
It's not going to well?
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
How are you doing?
Fine... I guess. You?
What kind of things?
I thought you met someone else.
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
...the Michelin commercial...
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
An eight.
Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole. This is turning into quite a rivalry.
...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
Go for it, man.
What's the point?
That's your problem, man. You can't see what you've got, only what you've lost. Those guys are right. You are "money".
How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
Give me the money. I'll get it.
Hey, man, you're not from here. You don't know how it is. I grew up in L.A...
What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike again. Could you just call me when you get in? I'll be up for awhile, and I'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all... 
Lemme get off the other line, baby.
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
That's not cool.
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
Oh, they're watching all right. They're watching.
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
She smiled, baby.
She likes you.
Oh fuck that. You don't have to try and impress anyone. You think I give a shit? You think I sweat that skanky whore waitress...
Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
"Big Brother", "Little Brother"?
Yes!
Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
What?
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
I just need some time...
Why? So you can beat yourself up? Sitting around in that stuffy apartment. It's just plain bad for you, man. It's depressing. You've come so far. Remember the first week? After she told you? You couldn't even eat.
...a day...
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
It starts at eight...
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
You're money.
...it's definitely on.
...Okay, two...
Our little baby's growing up...
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return.
No, just you and Paulie.
Understood.
We gotta move...
Probably all the other families will line up against us.  But, it's alright.  These things have to happen once every ten years or so...gets rid of the bad blood. You gotta stop 'em at the beginning. Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at Munich, they shoulda never let him get away with that, they were just asking for big trouble...
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
But you needed a drink first.
Yes.
You wanted me to be your son.
There are men in this world who demand to be killed.  They argue in gambling games; they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender. These people wander through the streets calling out "Kill me, kill me."  Luca Brasi was like that. And since he wasn't scared of death, and in fact, looked for it...I made him my weapon.  Because I was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him.  I think you have done the same with this man.
Good.
Godfather, you understand everything.
Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen.
An Act of Congress!
You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
We're all tired...
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
And when they shot me father...
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
Mama, no.
Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.
I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about Rocco Lampone building a secret regime.  Why does Neri report directly to you, rather than through me or a caporegime?
Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.
You really want to know?
Michael, I love you.
...who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated.
Sure.
Just you.
Hello...this is Long Distance.  I have a call from New Hampshire.  Mr. Michael Corleone.  One moment please.
I love you.
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
Can you say it?
Tell me you love me.
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
How can you be sure?
Until the old man tells me different.
I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
All right, Sonny.  All right.
Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign.
Be patient.
I can arrange security.
The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone family wants to buy you out.
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
No, I like him.
Then I'll go to your place and you can move in with Tom.
Yes please!
Okay.
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.
No, still here.
I love jazz.
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
This is so good of you.
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
Copy out from here...
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
I did. And then maybe get the jacket and what have you...
I don't know! Why are you asking me?  How can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
I'm prepared to take the blame.
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
Oh God, I don't think so.
The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --
What are you doing?
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
Tom. How are you? You look well.
Far cry from New York.
Well, if we all pushed him away what about him pushing us away? You've been a great friend to my son. Everything is someone else's fault. We all want to sow wild oars. Somebody's got to -- what's the word?  The moment someone confronts him he lashes out. He lashes out. You know, people always say you can't choose your parents, but you can't choose your children.
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
No, he should talk to you alone.
San Remo. The police are amateurs. Well, my boy, it's come to a pretty pass, hasn't it?
Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts --
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
I absolutely agree with Marge.
Tom, I love you!  See!  I bought it for him, for his birthday.
Marge, when did you get here?
He's having an early night.
Poor man.  We were knocking on that door for ever.  I think I've broken my strap.
What are you going to do now, Tom?
How would you know that?
That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith said --  Meredith's the American girl I saw last night, I know her, at the Opera, she's been seeing something of Dickie --
A hotel would've been fine.  We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far his dollar has stretched.
No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi.  And now look at you.
No, it's just -- you are American, aren't you? -- no, I just, I have so much luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined. It's humiliating.
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
What?
Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life.
I've never admitted that to anyone.
What?
Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.
Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il signor Ripley ha visto il signor Greenleaf? 
Are you a homosexual?  Interesting non-sequitur.
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
Tell him I have a fiancée, Dickie has a fiancée and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.
You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things.
Postmortem?
Of course. What happened to your face?
I don't remember the exact date.
Does he stay with you here?
31 people.
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée?
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then?
It's hell out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over. 
I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box.
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"
The moon?
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
What?
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
I'm getting a taxi.
Hello, Betsy.
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
No, why?
How long has he been there?
I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
He's Black, OK?
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
No, I'm serious, really...
That's fine.
No.
Yeah.
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."
A real skunk.
Well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of fares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
That's the guy. Eddie calls him up and says, "Hey, what do you want me to do. I'm over here at Poly Prep. I got a girl in the back and she doesn't have the fare. She wants me to come in back and collect. What should I do?
Well... I guess so.
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
You want to make it like this? 
Do they drug you?
I can leave anytime I want.
I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
I can't sleep nights.
Military record?
Why do you ask?
Oh?
You would, huh?
Take it or leave it.
Iris?
Hey!  Now there's some good news.
I join the F.B.I. I ask for fieldwork.  They say, "Bill, you're too fucking= smart for field work." Every year I put in for a transfer and every year I= sit in that goddamn lab like the fucking Maytag repairman in the= commercial.  Then the call finally comes, and it's a whole fuckin, city at= stake?  Oh Jesus...
What is happening?  Where's Mason?
What, vou?
An F.B.I. Man asking me for a break. How droll.
Partners.
What's that?  Mason?
Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
That always used to work.
You look... different.
I do?
How'd they get it inside?
It doesn't seem right, this being down here.  It ought to be where people can see it.
Whoa.
Oh.
Have you got a cigarette?
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
I do.
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.
Shhhhhh.
I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
The days of the storefront grocery are numbered.  I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
Harry, son.  Harry.
And... what's my name again?
Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
When did I leave?
Nine and-a-half years...
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
Don't tell me, I know about these things.  I've seen it before.  It's all right.  It's... all right. You're here.  Oh, God, I love you, son.
The G-man?
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
This is not a bender yet.  This is the start of a bender.  But I can see how you were confused, they look a lot alike.
Pete...
Thanks.
It's okay, son.  We just need to call you something.  That's all.
Wish I could say the same thing.
Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is.  "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters.  Now, did you go to any meetings?
Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?
Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.
Not at all.
Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
No, I...
Yeah.  I hope you don't mind.  I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry.  And me.
Of course.
Thanks.
You look familiar, fella.  What's your name?
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
Which is why the mail in this town never gets delivered to the right place.  Did you want to see Cathy about something?
It's a lovely garden.
It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
I guess that's where everyone meets him.
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels. Do you want a sweater or something? A quilt?
I despise it.
I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
And what had you done?
I don't understand.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
Mom, they're in a cage!
Well, I suppose...
Could I have a puff?
Darling, of course I do!
Shhh. Shhhhh.
It's Alice, ain't it?
Yep.
And the white house?
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
D'you want me to order one for you?
The little Brenner girl?
Can I have the boat in about twenty minutes?
Young woman cut herself.
We'll make our own fog.
No. Here's fine. 
Lovebirds, I see.
I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?
I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
I got them all, Mother.
I don't know.
You're doing fine.
We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack.
You don't have to.
What?
I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
Yes.
I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
And locked it.
Please.
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
Well...  Well... these birds attacked us.
Yes.
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
Are they moulting now?
All right.  She smiles back.
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
Hey, wait a minute!
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
Oh, no you don't!
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
Right next to the one you already had.
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
Dinner's just about ready.  We were out back looking at the chickens. Something seems to be wrong with them.
Without any clothes on?
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
I told you what happened in Rome!
I think it could be fun.
I thought you knew! I want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked! Good night!
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
No, thank you.
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
It's an uprising.
Mmm?
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
Don't let's take any chances.
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
Yes, certainly. 
Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
...insist on making it difficult for life to survive on this planet. If it weren't for birds...
For what purpose?
Can we go on living here otherwise?
Mr. Gray?
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
Well? And are you not a good student?
Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
But you did promise.
Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
What?
You'll be a good doctor.  I know all about doctors.
An old acquaintance, eh?
I want it --
I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
A student.  I'm studying under Dr. MacFarlane -- that is, I've been studying until today --
I am the best man for the job.
That's a good boy, Toddy.
I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
I take no gifts from you.
Give me money or I'll tell the police you murder the "subjects."
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
Eighteen persons they killed and sold the bodies to Dr. Knox at ten pounds for a large and eight pounds for a small. That's good business, Joseph.
No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
How long ago?
Three years.
Then all my surgery is no good. There's something wrong with the child -- something I don't know -- something I can't define -- can't diagnose.  I can do nothing for her.
You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
Tell her... we'll get him.
Someday he'll surface and I'll get him for both of you. I promise. I'll find the guy with the scar.
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
Yeah. I sure will.
I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
Where the fuck did you come from?
I don't know you, man.
They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
Why? Why's anything happen? It's all money, man. Money. The girl just got in the way.
I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
I don't know. I found him lying there.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
Good for you. You do know something.
Christ. It was Corvis. Tommy Leonard was right.
You mean Alex.
I want you... to bend over.
What's that supposed to mean? He was right here. He was!
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
It's not what you think.
No.
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
That's good, Hilda. I'm glad.
It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time.
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
I assure you such power exists.
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.
Tell me what?
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.
Where is that?
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
No -- I'm afraid not.
I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.
Why not, Bobby?
Just Klaatu.
The present situation?
We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?
Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations.  I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions.
Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
I don't care about the rest of the world!
Goodnight, my dear.
May I see you for a minute?
May I walk out with you?
Who?
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
Remember those words.
I think I'm very lucky. You don't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
You might keep this.  I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem.
But I suppose you know the answer.
How long will that take?
We don't ride with vampires.
We blew it, Edgar!  We lost it!
Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.
That's just the way we like it.
You know what?  You're absolutely right.
No.  Stick around.
I will, David!
Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
Good!
I know it was them, Star.  I'm sure of it.  He was working in the yard -- hammering something.  The yard was big with lots of grass.  There was no boardwalk and no ocean.  She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
We can't talk about it on the phone.
Sorry, Mom.  It was a mistake. I thought I saw something out the window.  I was reading this horror comic and I guess I go a little carried away...
C'mere, Nanook.
What happened?  Is everybody all right?!
Hi, Thorn.
Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
I'm Michael.
No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
When?
Okay.
Because I love you...
Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
Entertain yourself.
No.
Don't turn on the light.
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year...
It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.
Ah... He was hurt bad.  Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.
Maybe.
What?
Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart.
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
You lying bastard...
I guess I'm the only one.
Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
You reach anybody yet?
Well, stick to it.
Extinguishers.
Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
I ain't going with Sanchez.
Anyplace but here.
Bet the last place you ever go.
Get your gear on.
Who else could have used that key?
He's one of them.
Hear what?
What else can they do?
But you're only a mud carrier.
This is it?
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
Yes... Thank you.
End...?
Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long.
You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
They survived above.  Became what they are.
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
No...
It's always the tiger for you, Alexander, haven't you learned that by now?...
Does this prove something to you? Have you made some great stand of which I'm unaware?
And why not?
I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
Hold on... I know I have it...
A moonstone.
Your birth stone.  I thought --
Darling.
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
In a week... we will never have had this conversation.
Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
You can see so many here.
Yes.
All of you?
I can see Kalen's point.
What are you?
Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
So you can use it now?
Yes... I suppose so.
Do you have it?!
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
May I get you some --
No, sir --
Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
Very good.  Now if you will excuse us for a moment.
No...
My father has gone to a better place.
Yes, sir.
Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
I am.  Are you a climber?
They're inside --
Kalen, look at me.  There's no one here but us.  You see... I'm here, you're here, Alexander's here. There are no Morlocks.  It was just a dream...
And you've no idea where he went?
No, sir.
I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
We never should have done this to him...
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
Then how would you describe him, Beth? Merely rebellious?
Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
He didn't either.
Sure.
No, it hasn't.
Yes. [Beat] It has. Everything up 'till today is done. Everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs.
His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
Oh, yeah.
It's December 25th, 1993 today.
Yeah.
If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?
You think Lorenson kills you?
You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
No, he didn't.
Good. How's your mom?
I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.
That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.
Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
2004.
Why not?
William, that is just another facet of my delusions.
Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?
Is it true?
You don't have anywhere to stay?
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.
You like it?
[Beat] I do it.
[Beat] Why?
May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are.
No you won't.  You'll be back today. Now!  You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do you understand me?
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
Aw, God.
Umm, yes.  She was driving.
Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
If waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature, then nothin' will, and I could've told you that Harlan Puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot. I'm just surprised it didn't happen before now.
Alright, Lena.  Go on home.  We might have to call you in for some more questioning.
How are things goin' out there?
Oh, definitely.
What for?
Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.
Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't I bring it to you?  For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
Not yet.
I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?
It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel.  The address is 1921 North East 23.  It's under your name.
I don't know.  It doesn't even matter anymore.  I just want you to be happy... It's not that I don't love you either.  But Jimmy, your timing couldn't be worse.
I'm choking on it.
You wanna let me see your license, please?
Okay.  I will, too.
Well, I've had it up to my ass with sedate!  You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. Well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!
Yeah!
Get the car!
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about this!  Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will!  You understand?
That's puttin' it mildly.
You are so sweet to that guy, you really are.  Imagine not wanting to drag him into this.  He is a lucky man.
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
Yes!  I believe I am!
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
Before.
Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
Harlan.
Hit it.
I believe you.
Yeah, you want it?
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
I said all that?
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
What?
Why?
What in the hell is that up there?
It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
Then let's not get caught.
Fuck that.
Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
You sent that?
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
I don't know.
His mother?
Never met him.
Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash.
You know, clean the pipes.
Pipes? What are you talking about?
I'm usually too tired to be.
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
Out getting coffee.
From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas.
You hot shit. Ya look fuckin' pisser.
No I can't.
Not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit. That's been my experience anyway.
By the way, what's your name?
What's that?
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
That sounds like fun.
-- Love story of our time.
Uh-huh.
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
I said buttplug. She's heinous.
Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.
Harvard?
Did you study under Kim Greene?
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
Friend. Baseball bat.
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
Why you son of a --
I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
It means you're too hard on guys.
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
He's no Steve Young.
Healy.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
Oh Jesus...
Are you all right?
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
What are you?
I agree there should be more.
Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.
Why not?
Go!
But I think I'd be happiest... with you.
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
Eh.
Uh-huh.
I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.
Then you'll call, right?
He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway --
Kenny. It's over.
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
Says what, Kenny?
So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.
Yes, sir. We can be sure we get all the missiles, and we remove Castro so this can never happen again.
We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.
General, the Joint Chiefs have just signaled our intent to escalate to the Soviets. You have signaled an escalation which I had no wish to signal, and which I did not approve.
I said his heart, not his attention.
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.
I'm gonna protect those pilots.
If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
Okay, Ken. We're going.
And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
Will somebody find out what's going on?!
Don't get too attached.
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
FBI? What you investigatin'?
Again. Figures, man.
No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother.
Airborne. That's where they used to get us agents from. Now we get 'em from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League. Accountants and computer whiz-kids. Yuppies with guns.  That's scary shit.
I got one up on ya.
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
She's that subtle?
What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch.
He knows me?
He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux. What did he say?
And...
The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.
Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
-- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. He started running for the open grass. With the car moving, Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. And some chicken feed. Stale chicken feed with four days mold.  Electromagnetic printing.
It's not real.
What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
1868...
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
He hasn't left this place in twenty years. They got him.
When you see Jimmy, tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in... the sooner we back off this reservation. Okay?
No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
Leo Fast Elk... is alive.
How the hell do you know?
You turned Leo over on his face. But the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. It's out, and it knows.
Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?!
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
How so?
And on to a bigger one with you?
I'm with someone.
Yeow!
How did you know this was my car?
That's all!
Where did you see that?
It's classified.
Where were you?
No.
Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?
Uh hum.
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
I'm starting to sense that now.
You're horrible
You ever think about killing another human being?
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
I don't know yet.
Anything.
That's not what I hear.
You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
What truth?
Off me or off you?
That's three.
...Something like that.
Tomcats?
Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
Maintaining course. Straight for Mustang.
YEAH, COUGAR?
Let's hope you're right!
These guys are getting on my nerves.
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
BREAKING LEFT!
What do you want?
Any more MiGs?
Did what?
This is Maverick.
On your six -- coming hard. Four hundred. Losing airspeed! He's on your six and closing fast! Hard left! HARD LEFT!
He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw.
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
Nope. It's the way he flies - Ice cold. No mistakes. Wears you down. After enough time, you just get bored and frustrated, you do something stupid, and he's got you.
You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.
No. You can be mine!
Just below ten thousand.
What the hell you doing?
Bad?
Yes sir.
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
Of course you did. I said a great flyer, not a smart one. You fly reckless. Great instincts. No discipline. That ambush today, you followed your emotions instead of your wingman. Of course you got killed...and well deserved to. It was a really stupid mistake. In battle, it gets people killed.
Goose is dead.
My wife's house.
He was by the book, all the way.
I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men.
Why not?
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!
The Last Resort!  Quick!
How'd you find me?
So why am I still alive?
Forty-one A, Ernie.
Swallow this.
O.K., everybody pull out!
C'mon!
Rekall?
What are you, my father?
The door opened.  You got it.
Quit while you're ahead.
I don't know.
Tell me!
Let's do it.
Do what?
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
And you believe him?
Let me finish!
--I got a trip to Mars.
Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
Bullshit.
You're talking ancient history, Doug. Nowadays, traveling with Rekall is safer than getting on a rocket.  Look at the statistics.
Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
You.  You're the same.  No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you.  Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip".
I'm not interested in that.
What's he talking about?
Forget I said wife.
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
Cannon fuse.
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?
Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find <u>me</u>.  This is important, you know.  This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.  The century?  Forget it.  <u>History</u>.
I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.
What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE <u>HELL</u> IS GOING ON?!!
A man who plans ahead.
Great.  Thank you.
You got <u>that</u> right!
It's out last one.  We can't kill them all.
Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
If that ain't the truth.  And I count on them for a little bit of stew meat...Thank you, Fred.
I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
Around here?  Why would they?
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
It does.
They're working together, too.
Good point.
Please... I need to sleep...
I know about Esparza.
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
I have to talk to your brother.
I noticed.
Dowd. Eddie Dowd.
Let's snuff this lowlife!
Hey -- the fact you popped Jimmy Chin in broad daylight proves it wasn't premeditated. Jury'll sympathize -- dude was banging your wife, right?
I didn't take my eyes off it!
No further questions.
No. No...
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
I specialize, Roger...
-- Remember?
You really think that's what happened?
"Have to"? No...
-- Yeah?
George is a fucking burnout case. I didn't want him on the stand anyway. Get more names from Billy.
Roger Baron.
You sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.  Nice.
...What do you mean?
-- Eddie...
I've got a meeting in Chinatown.
...For ten years, now.
And I call your testimony hearsay. I have no more questions for you.
But I like that theory. And since I'm not putting Twerp Professor on the stand, and since I don't have a better theory, I'm sticking with that theory. Meantime I want pictures of the Joes. What'll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like Shu to fool the eyewitnesses!
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
Nothing has. But that's all changing.
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
How can I tell you what I don't know!
Y-yes, sir.
You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.  We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt.  So what've you been up to since then?
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
Objection.
-- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
If I were sitting where I normally sit, I would say "Calls for speculation."
And who were the detectives who assisted you, Mr. Reynard?
So what'd this guy do? Snitch off a dealer?
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
Blonde.
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
Go away. I am not talking to you.
Why? Why not? Where are you goin'?
You're lucky I am not wasting you.
That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
Oh, alright.  You know, I liked Agent Desmond. He had his own M.O.
Stanley, I heard all about it.
That would indicate that it's the future.
Sorry to hear it.
No.
How do you figure?
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
That's good.
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
Noooo...
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
Thanks.
When?
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
Dancing.
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
Cause I like it.
What'll it be?
You got it.
I did? I didn't see anything.
Yeah... look in here. Look at it from this angle.
Brother, I hear you talkin'.
No... No...
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
Did you make me a tape?
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
Let's go all the way.
Okay.
What do you mean?
"Oh, Laura..."
When he finds out.
You want to see...
Right. Open your eyes, James. You don't know me. Even Donna doesn't know me. Your Laura disappeared... It's just me now.
Trees?
What were you doing in my room?
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
But my name isn't Leland Palmer.
...school's fine...
A friend from school.
A special friend?
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
No.
This is serious. Mr. Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. Sarah, you first.
How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
How do you know what she doesn't like?
Who am I?
Anybody can clean the surface of an object, but dirt can find its way anywhere. To really clean, you have to scrub below the surface.  WHERE THE DIRT IS, SHELLY.
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
You're right. There's no one here.
There's no one here.
Abrams...
Yes.
Very good.
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
It's a crime.
Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion.
I am seventy-four years old.
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
I'm going to uphold that.
We went to Code Blue...
'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
Yes.
...We did everything we could...
You ruined my life, Mister... Me and my wife... and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl. We been going four years.  Four years... my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
Why is that?
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps. Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
I am on the staff of...
Right. Who called?
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
You live in the neighborhood?
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Mrs. Simmonds.
One hour.
Yes.
Why is that?
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
That happens.
Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off?
And are they going to get it?
Yes.
You want me to tell you it's your fault? It probably is. What are you going to do about it?  I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
Is there going to be a later...?
Call the A.M.A.  ...I can't talk now.  ...tell them you're Dr. Somebody... you have to find this nurse...
I can't guarantee that...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
From the magazine?
Nothing happened.
...we, we love her, Dick and me...
...I'm sure you do...
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
...fifty thousand dollars?
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
I'm going to see you get that chance.
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
He's... you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.  He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
...now who is that...?
What do you want?
You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand?  Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
...I have to stand up for her...
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up.
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
Mary Rooney. She won't talk to me. I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.
You use their witness.
That's right.
She told me.
We, we were rather busy...
The Big Boy did...?
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
Would you like some coffee, General?
It's gone now.
Where are we?
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
That's the kind of a kid brother you'd have!
It's pointing out to the gully - where that meteor came down.
I believe we can get a lead from their anaemic blood.
Thank you, sir.  If they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!
There's a square dance at the social hall this evening.
I've done about all I can do here. You go back in.  Sylvia - I like that Doctor Forrester.  He's a good man.
Come on.  Kids love horror.
You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
Chase, you'd better come home.
Heather, has there been another call?
Diabetes?
Oh my God...
They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
Just for a few hours.  Julie'll be with you.
What?
Bye.
Right.
Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
Coming for you...
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually. 
Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
I'm afraid there was an accident.  It appears he fell asleep while driving, ma'am.
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
Now?
Black's fine.
It's time these boys saw some real blue water.
Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
You're not a moron.
Me either.
Nobody says you have to be like me.
You only hurt yourself you know?
We all have problems.
No, I didn't.
Yes.
I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
It doesn't matter.  Really.  I'm just sorry you got chewed out.
Of a fight he can't win out here.
It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it...
Your cannons made a compelling argument.
Take good care of my son.
And, of course, we are.
It's okay.  I'll be in, in a minute.  Look, what do you want?
Yes.  I do.
That's enough.
I can show you how to use a slide rule.
Why'd you jump?
Okay donut.  Whatever you say.
I don't have to listen to this.
You know what he is talking about here?
What is it... the secret?
About yourself?
You've gotta be kidding?
Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
No way Phil.  Not like this.
I can't be sure.
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
Screw you, Valentino.  I haven't seen you swapping spit with anybody.
Fuck me.
Someday honey, I will... But I have to be goin' now... Conta i no joras...
Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well.
Why not?
Whattaya mean family?
Yeah... yeah... I guess so... That kind'a money'd get us a long way down that yellow brick road...
Told ya I would. You still riled?
You heard from Reggie?
You say it's straight ahead a mile?
Not for lack of love, I can tell ya that.
Muchas gracias.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen.
Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.
Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.
No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad...
What?
This 'bout the fifth time?
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
Peanut...
Stab it and steer.
Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon. A man can't ask for more than that.
I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin' her hair dyed? And I was alone in the house.
Didn't he say somethin'?
'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?
Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
That don't seem fair.
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
It ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain't too proud of, but I'll tell ya from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason. All I know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there.
So?
There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
Yeah, I suppose. But you know somethin' baby, hair does make a difference.
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
Sorta brown, blonde, I guess. But dig this, sweetie. Then she turns over, peels off them orange pants, and spreads her legs real wide and says to me...
We got through two states already.
You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em?
I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off. Felt awful. He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it.
It's just another case, Sailor.
I do.
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
More'n likely.
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
Told you not to call your mama.
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
SAILOR!!!
No radio or TV...
Maybe. Met a guy named Red, owns a garage, could have some work in about a week. Met a few hard luck boys who's stayin' here. What's that smell?
No, I don't think so, Sail. I just need to lie down.
That was in Vietnam.
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
Shake hands with your daddy.
Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?
I ain't that dumb, mama. Sailor and I been on a crime spree? Knockin' off convenience stores all across the south? Ain't you read about it?
Mama... if you get in the way of me and Sailor's happiness, I'll fuckin' pull your arms out by the roots.
Yes... Get rid of him.
Explain it... I told you.
Shoot him? Like with a gun?
In the head.
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
That's just another part of the price to pay.
Where we goin'?
Well, she wants to fuck you.
Whattya mean?
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
By who?
Well?...
Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.
The candelabras were my Gran's.
He's right, you look horrible.
Brimming. Say hello to my new friend, Miss Antonia... uh...
Your wife.
I just mean...
She left me. Crabs.
Not Curtis.
Tripp, where the hell...
Sometimes we have to improvise.
Only in your bones?
What's to tell?
Nevertheless. There's a police officer standing on the porch and I don't think he's going away.
Bullshit.
I've been doing that a lot lately.
The last month maybe.
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
Are you there to not reconcile with her?
It's not bad.
Well...
A little.
I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
Right.
You mean, with your wife leaving you and all?  Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note.
Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP!
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
But... ?
Who?
Hm.
Where's that?
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
I never heard of it.
Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.
What kind of dancer?
Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.
Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
It's Walter's dog and yes, she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the hail.
I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage.
I think Walter would find this a little more than surprising.
She's left the room before. She always came back.
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
I think I might've said I was in love with you.
I lost it all.
I'm not sure that's possible.
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
He'd call it habit. But now... I get the feeling he's going through the motions a bit.
As a heart attack.
Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.
That's weird.
Just kidding.
I might have his number on campus.
Mr. Crabtree was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.
If he's happy...  I'm happy.
Foreman now.
No shit.
Five years.
Booming. Lots of building going on. We can't keep up with all the work. In fact, I just hired a few new guys...
I like the noise.
How is she?
When can I see her?
I'm working on it.
You need a table.
It wasn't like that.
Early July.
Isn't it?
Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.
I'm just talking, man.
I know. I'm just saying I understand.
Sure.
Birds.
The mother sure has her hands full.
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
I can't.
Were you watching me?
Do you come here often?
Got something to hide?
I could get a search warrant.
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
I didn't say what time the assault occurred.
I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
It's a free country, isn't it?
Are you taking your medication?
Yeah.
Why's that?
No you're not.
It sounds like you were banished.
Are you sure?
They sound like finches.
Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does.
I can't.
Someone will talk to your daddy. And then he'll stop doing those things... the things you don't like.
It's getting dark. Go home.
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
You seem a little hostile today.
I'd like you to keep a journal.
A diary?
I don't understand.
That's right.
Then think about it.
You have no feelings for your niece?
Why do you think you're here?
Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen.
Sorry.  Where is she?
In my bedroom, sleeping.
I was six years old!
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
Are you okay?
It's fucking freezing out here.
Guess I'm not like most women.
What about them?
What?
So... what's your dark secret?
Since you've had sex?
Yeah.
Twelve years in prison?
The judge had a thing about sex offenders. Later I heard his daughter had been raped. If I hadn't had a good lawyer, it would have been twenty- five to thirty.
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
Get your kicks somewhere else.
No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.
They seduce you?
Nothing. It's over.
What odds?
The percentages --
No you don't.
Move in with me.
I think it's a fucking good idea.
I'm not scared.
I'm alright, I'm dealing.
Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.
Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes.
I'm taking you back out.
Yeah, okay.  Okay.
I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
Not for long.
Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a disaster.
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
But what did he see that made him panic?
If you say so.  It could be anything.
Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance, over.  Deepcore, this--
Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere...
They'll come out after us.
We've only got one suit.
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time.  Look at this...  Time I get back you'll be--
What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.
FUCK LOGIC!!
Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
I can't... make it... podner.
Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
Just hold your water, okay?  So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
1840... 50... 60... 70...
What a question... Because I want to be with you, naturally. I hope he doesn't close the deal so he'll leave me alone at least for a few days... Isn't this water wonderful!
What could be more restful than this?...  Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?
Fine. Can't you see so yourself?
It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.
All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
That's Patrizia's way of letting us know she's with us.
And why do you tell us this only now?
And how do you explain that?
Yes, very much so.
Don't think that I want to save myself from any embarrassment, from the awkwardness of meeting Anna... It's not that; it's that you can say certain things easier if you're alone. Please, Sandro, do try to understand me... It would look like I was trying to influence you, to force you, to control you... and that makes me feel uncomfortable...
Then why do you say them?
And why did you drop them?
What! Get married?
Yes, yes, yes, yes... Right away...
So, you wonder why?
Oh, Sandro... I want everything you do. But...
You said you wanted to quit working for Ettore.
I deserve it.
It means being without money.
But for what reason should I come there?
Please, Giulia; must you always emphasize the obvious? I can see for myself that the weather is changing.
When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.
Well, we're still in Italy, you know!
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
It wouldn't really do you any harm to skip a meal.
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other.  Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat?
What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
Who told you this?
Why?
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
You've got to eat something Agnes.
I don't know.
In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins.
What do you mean?
Was it Sister Marguerite?
I don't know.
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
Oh, I know he does.
Oh, yes.
Would you like to talk about it?
I don't know.
No. I was sick.
I got sicker.
What baby?
From their heads...
Would you like some?
Does it bother you?
Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
Somebody told her.
I was a mistake.
That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
No...
Yes.
How?
She...
Yes.
That you're a mistake?
I'm afraid.
No I'm not.
Yes.
Yes.
Because I was afraid.
Yes.
Yes.
I ate.
No.
Go away, I don't want you here.
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
Of course you do. Who was it?
Yes.
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake.
No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
Marty, what are you doing here?
You got to be crazy.
You're too involved Marty.  Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else?
When?
No!
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
How do you survive?
What business is it of yours..?
I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
None as far as I know.
Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
I am not with the Inquisition.
I believe Agnes is different.
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
That she was unconscious, yes!  So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
How dare you tell me to run my affairs!
I am...
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
The sheets...
Oh, Dear God, I should have guessed...
About what?
I don't think I care to know.
Oh God, if only I'd known.
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
Because I didn't know... 
You just said...
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
And Saint John would chew tobacco.
Do you think they ever existed?
For the Church?
You think she's a saint?
Who is he?
Why must he be anybody?
Don't be ridiculous.
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
Why would I lie?
Hasn't she had enough?
She didn't want any help.
That's a lie.
No!
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
Before or after you killed the child?
I left it with her and I went for help.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
What happened to the baby?
They are?
Just you?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Well!
Oh, yes, now I'm with you. [he changes his accent] But, gee, Mister, I've got my license to think of ... we're doing a hundred now ...
No. I don't.
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
Of course I can.
I beg your pardon?
Wake up!
We do.
Follow your impulse.
I'll look in here again.
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
How'd you guess?
Something like that.
What's that mean?
Oh aye, a sledge.
What are you?
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
Oh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she's trying to get him to marry her but he doesn't want ... well ... I don't reckon any fella's ever wanted to get married. But girls are like that, clever and cunning. You've got to laugh.
Yes.
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
I'm not wrong.
Lip reading.
What's he on about?
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
Yeah ... so what?
Well, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. He can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. And his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it.
For Ringo.
You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
What little old man?
That little old man.
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
What's old got to do with it?
You needn't bother.
Ah, go on, you swine.
No, you can't. Look, as soon as I tell you, run through this door here and into the big car that's waiting.
Well you're not going.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
Don't exaggerate.
But...
Yeah, down the ... er ...
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
But John hasn't got any.
You were twanging too loud.
A proper Aborigine.
Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.
... I don't know...
What's the terrain down there?
Can you see anything in the hole?
A transmission?
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
Hard to say.
Well, get started.
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
Right.
Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
Sounds like a rough one.
No.
We're not going anywhere.
How many?
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.
Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?
Who knows?
Help me -- I'm going to try to get it off.
Is it still dripping?
We're going into the freezers now.
Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.
We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it.
That's the one about the albatross, right?
We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.  We are utterly, absolutely alone.  Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  Halfway across Creation...
We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
And you and I will bag it, and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock, got it?
Right.  Fire up all systems.
What killed it?
Still worried?
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
We can't leave him out here, open the door.
With great pleasure.
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
Here, carry these.
Kablooey.
What can I do?
The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it.
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
Yeah.  Turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace.
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
Has anybody talked to them?
But...
I'm picking up another signal.
It's alright, it's cool...
Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself.  Where's the disk?
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
Okay, I pull the access panel off of the console.  Insert the disk, and press the green enabling button...
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
Didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh?
Is that a fact.
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
I'm out of ammo.  Get inside, get inside!
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
'Bout five minutes.
Give me a yell is something happens.
I consider myself lucky they didn't throw things.
We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will?
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...
Oddly enough - she didn't say a word about Margo. Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that I play the part.
It wasn't meant to be.
Frankly - yes.
Almost four.
You sat and talked until it was light...
I don't know what I take you for anything...
Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
What of it?
Because I don't want to.
It's the same thing, isn't it?
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.
I was there. An eyewitness.
You were there? At the play - last night?
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
Amen.
Maybe just a little around the edges.
Thank you so much.
I'm a junk yard.
Heaven help me, I love a psychotic.
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
I told her. I sounded off.
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
When - when are you coming back?
- in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
Cut it out.
This is my house, not a theater! In my house you're a guest, not a director-!
Remind me to tell you about when I looked into the heart of an artichoke.
So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair...
Nothing, really...
I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
Why.
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
So few come back...
You shouldn't have had any doubts.
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
What have I got to do with it?
You're quite a girl.
You think?
The same size?
Well. I guess a real tight girdle help when you're playin' a lunatic.
Miss Coonan...
You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
How do you mean that?
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
Late for what?
Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
I - I guess I fell asleep.
You rest. I'll get it...
You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
Standing room doesn't cost much. I manage.
She's got to meet you-
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality...  ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket...  ... you've done your share, Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo...
I think she would cheer.
You won't forget it?
I seem to be forever thanking you for something, don't I?
There can't be very much-
I wish I could believe that.
Of course it is.
Performance number one thousand of this one - if I play it that long - will take place in a well-padded booby hatch...
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Mr. Sampson's birthday. I certainly wouldn't forget that. You'd never forgive me.  As a matter of fact, I sent him a telegram myself...
Of course.
Really, Eve? Why?
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...
Not many car either, not much chance of a lift...
Be brave. He'll come back - with or without gas.
It get better! "- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity-"
With tears.
Check.
Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
That's on time for Margo.
Eve.
That was a pity...
I wonder why.
Now you're quoting Addison. Or Eve.
I'm glad Bill's back.
What is he talking about?
When you do, let me in on it.
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
I'm sure.
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
It's about time the piano realized it has not written the concerto!
I mean really, deeply angry...
I don't think I could be.
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
I placed...?
When's the audition?
All you got to do is name it.
You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max.
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
Not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill!
--mine's better--
Yeah?
Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.
Facts or theory?
It's safe, try it, you'll see.
Who'd you vote for?
Nixon.
--Colson.
--I know, I know--
--has he got an ax?--
Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
--We got twenty minutes to deadline--
Hmm?
Only everything...
John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
--jeeeeeeesus--
11:30.
By "they" you mean...?
During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
You're the fella who forgot he rented a Hertz car, do I have to tell you they didn't forget to send us the bill?
--what about you?--
Five hundred; six maybe.
--you don't really think you're being followed?
I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
--right, right, I've got to go.  Why did you lie just then?
It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
Who by?
Irwin? I really feel bad, doing something like this--you know that, don't you?
Well, they sure didn't ask us to come forward and tell the truth.
I will not talk about the other two.
Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?
OK.  You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook.  Just be right, huh?
--you have nothing more to say, I understand that.
Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
...check...?
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
To where?
Go on.
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
The slush fund at CREEP financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so--
Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
--you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
James McCord.
Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
--quit equivocating, say what you mean--  --our story got Government Accounting to start an audit on CREEP's finances--
Two o'clock, work the phones 'til you go.
Thanks, Harry.  Know anything about Colson?
I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
--go over your sources again--
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
Thanks coach.
-- Thanks, coach --
First of all, it's <u>Mocha</u>ccino, and secondly...Oohhhh!
Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."
What's your middle name?
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
I know, it sucks!
Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
Thanks.  It was my idea.
Uh...
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
So, does my hair look better --  like this, or...  like this?
But --
Yeah, enormous.
Went home to shit.
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
Oh...oh...oh, shit!
Oz, how about you and Heather?  Now you guys are a couple or something?
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
What was your name again?
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
C-Span?
Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer --  Cool Hip Jim...  or Laid Back Jim?
I know.
Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy.  I am now a man.
Okay.
God dammit, Stifler!
This just got a hell of a lot better.
It's everyone's trick, Kevin.  But I did pick it up from you.
I think you're so right, Kevin.
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Me too.
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
This is different.  This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you.  Someone to keep you motivated.
Observe.
Attitude?  Me?  I think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!
I don't care.
Fuck yeah we will.
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Are you crazy!? You know that's totally impractical. Besides, like the Bible says...  An eye for an eye...
The key is don't look down.
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita.
Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.
"Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
Well, they are French.
You too.
Shut up! Save your stories. The only thing I want to hear is you begging for your life. I want to see you suffer, like they did.  Haha! You're scared now, eh? Come on. Where's the scary monster now huh? Ha ha... We'll see who -
And you call me a moron...
Looks like he lied to you too.
The cops. It's their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place, endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception, exploring new states of psychic awareness.
Yeah well, that's like really groovy and everything, but who hacked my uncle's legs off?
Uncle Terrence.
Andy? Andy is that you?
Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence -
Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
I never thought I'd ask this of anyone, Andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you?
Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?
Yeah, well, these fleas must have teeth like fuckin' chain saws.
Well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? Thanks for your help.
I told you. These murders are not normal.
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
Come out! I can do alterations.
I'll never let go!
Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
And we have found each other nothing will ever change that! I am your family, dear child, but I may not be your home.
I cursed then all!
That was your dinner!  I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
He's her?
"Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
I did no such thing!
This guy's on television! Alvy Singer, right? Am I right?
All the good meetings are taken.
What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
I prefer not to, because... look, they're laughing at him. See, so what are yuh telling me-
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Get him!
Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School.
Hey, that was last year.
Oh, I'd say so. You married-
I don't...  I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there...  What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift?
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
I'll getcha a piece.
Yeah. I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility.
Yeah, I know.
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Fifteen-aw, come on, you're... yeah, really?
M'hm...
Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.
Oh, sorry.
Well, who's Sadie?
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
Yeah!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay. Yeah.
Yeah?
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
Here, you want some?
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
Oh, yeah.
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
No-what, what...? I... we live together, we sleep together, we eat together. Jesus, you don't want it to be like we're married, do yuh?
It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
Uh-uh-why?
It's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you.
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
No.
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
Oh. What?
Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.
Yeah.
It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
Tsch, why don't we get... why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.
Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --
What thing?
Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.
Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
Thanks, honey.
Yeah.
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
This is my room.
Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.
No jokes-these are friends, okay?
Dammit! I was so close.
He's God! I mean, this man is God! He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
I mean that as a compliment.
This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
Oh, when'd you quit smoking?
Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
Ah.
We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
I'm gonna meet her in front of the Beekman. I think I have a few minutes left. Right?
We can show her the schoolyard.
What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Hi.
Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
Oh, yes, yes.
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
Oh, yeah, really, oh!
Yeah.
Oh, gosh.
I was very charming.
Absolutely.
And you've only just met.
The movie.
I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films.  But those were all such great directors.
What?
Scratch the two, write in a four.
I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a minute.
Didn't I say?
Borrow whatever you like.
Why would she care?
Just don't fucking tell her.
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
Yeah.
It's not a contest.
Damn straight.
I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
Oh, very jealous.
But she's alright.
Oh.  You're them.
Nice to meet you.
Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus.
Not as a rule.
Are you always this much fun?
Did you invite them?
I'm ready.
Happy anniversary.
No.  I missed that.
I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very worried about my brain and my spine.
You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
About me!
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
Anyone else?
Ah...
Ah.
And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see?
Oh don't.  Everyone says that.
Very well put.
And your phone calls are nasty and abusive.  And I've come this close to suing you for harassment.  And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you.
Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl.
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
Medallions.
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
Sorry?
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...
He always has two or three going...
Do you want to go home, Ryan?
There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
I'm going to go get my swimsuit.  I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry.  Ryan, you're a great man.
Are you working on a new book?
Really??
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
Not enough.
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
Like the last time.
I didn't hear me say tonight.
We're just feeling our way back.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
What are they?
Oh Soph...
Well good.  Thank God.
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
No weirdly...You remind me of someone...
OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU!  YOU'RE A WORKER!!!  A filthy, stupid, disgusting WORKER!
How should <u>I know</u>?
Well I guess that makes us even.
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Want a list?
Wait, I hear something!
General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
<u>This is all your fault</u>!!!
There's something going on, Z --
No one should have to.  Have him brought to me.
Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u>, we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u>, and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>!
Yes, what else?
Why are we so successful?
You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
Yeah, I know.
Don't tell anyone you're a worker. Follow that column over there.  And come right back after the inspection!
My mother.
Don't worry about the old lady. One squawk from her, and she's out of a job.
I didn't really do anything -- honest -- I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.
Sheldrake?
I've been here twice as long as you have --
Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
Really?
I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
No. Like a man.
Oh, I understand.
I know your height, your weight and your Social Security number -- you had mumps, you had measles, and you had your appendix out.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
No -- I like it.
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
Open it.
A cemetery?
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
I don't want to talk to him.
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?
Here.
In the knee?
Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs. 
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
Yes.  You walking to the subway?
Good night, Miss Kubelik.
Seven --  -- queen.
Shut up and deal!
I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year.
Swap them? For what?
That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
I am?
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
I hate to disturb you, but something came up -- it's rather important -- and I think it would be a good idea if you could see me -- at the apartment -- as soon as possible.
I didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who I mean -- I found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
You're going to take her off my hands?
Yeah --
Now I'll have to borrow your key.
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it -- because I'm all washed up around here.
Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
Mr. Sheldrake?
Listen to him.  Little Lord Fauntleroy!
Oh, I'm very grateful.
No!
Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.
Oh.  'Bye, Doc.
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
Yeah.  Well -- see you, Doc. 
Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late. You better put some coffee on -- and pray.
I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
These cases are harder on the doctor than on the patient. I ought to charge you by the mile.
It's regulations.
She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
Yeah, wasn't I?
Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.
Me? Oh, you mean my body. Don't worry, Doc -- it'll go to the University -- I'll put it in writing --
Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.  By the way, whatever happened to her?
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
Yeah, he's punchy. Talking to himself.
And what happened to you?
This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
I never said goodbye, Fran.
I wasn't trying.
Handle what?
Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
Okay, okay, Fran. I deserve that. But just ask yourself -- why does a man run around with a lot of girls? Because he's unhappy at home -- because he's lonely, that's why -- all that was before you, Fran -- I've stopped running.
Atlantic City?
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.
Lovely. You were a big help.
I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --
Good -- like I said, take your pick.
North ?
Tracks ?
That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
Cook school -- that did it.
I don't know.
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
Mangoes? There as a fucking tiger in the woods -- I could've been eaten alive. I'm never going into that jungle again. I gotta remember never get out of the boat; never get outta the boat.
Shot himself. What for ?
We found some bodies -- let's get out a here.
I think this river wants to take us home fast. I'm practically goin' in reverse.
Get in there now or I'll bury you in this river.
Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't believe he's capable of that. I just don't believe it.
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
What is it?
Charlie?
They must have seen the fire.
This gentleman or myself ?
I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.
Well, he's killing now.
What, sir?
What do you mean?
That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy.
Yeah. Classical stuff -- scares the hell out of the slopes -- the boys love it.
It'll get here, soldier.
Yes.
How's the pain?
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
Just something I read in the Free Press.
What is this bridge?
Why did they attack us?
Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
The war will still be here tomorrow.
I know.
Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
Anyone got a card?
Beverly Hills --
C'mon --
23   CONTINUED:  
Inside of three hours you'd be dragging my dead carcass.
I just want this over with.
How?  Nobody this far north monitors that frequency until avalanche season.  Besides, I'm surprised a tough guy like you uses fancy electronics.
I was gone, in September, laying traplines.  She went to our cache for some meat.  Got mauled by a bear.  Tore open her skull. -more-
Sam?  We haven't seen him.
Can't help myself.  Corbett's type always pisses me off.  Oh, I found this at the post office.  Had your name on it.
It's exactly what you meant.
You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.
You know Meyerling?
It's a spring day...
An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
I'm real sad you don't approve of me.
Don't bet on it.
I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.
Why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?
Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
Let's get out of here.
Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
I'll get loose before that plane comes.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
Nothing personal.
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
What does this matter to you?
-- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already.
Damn.  Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.
Get the fuck out of here.
Cool out.  I ain't about to get blasted.
We were just talking about him.
I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts.  This can't be right -- con- science.
No, I didn't.  So why are you h...
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
Emergency room only.
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
I see the help -- judgement call.
Spencer.
You're not worried that someone might take him?
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
No!!! Stay away from me!
He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
Thank you.
Now I want you to do something for me.
I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
Yes.
Whether crabs are in season there now...
Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say raise their hands.
Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
One baked -- one fries.
Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.
There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
It's one idea...
It was a mistake.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
Yeah... Well...
The two might go together.
Were you asleep?
I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
Stop staring. Do a vase.
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
You changed the room around...
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
What?
You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.
It smells like shit in here?
Another place where?
Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.
Aw come on, just a couple of questions -- how hard is that?
What restaurant?
What?
After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
Who the fuck cares about Cleveland. Cleveland blows.  What kind of marks have they got here?  Greasy mobster, teamster or some hand job politician.  I want the money marks. I want the marks that you get.
I ain't scared of you.
Shit.  That sure is a lot of money.
Oh, yeah.
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
Why don't you tell me.
I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
Now I'll tell you something.  It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you.
Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
I'm worried about you, Robert.
It cost us.
Where are we going?
What?  How did you know I had a cat?
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
You didn't know anything about me.
We don't have a choice.
It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
Yeah.
Why?
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
He was killed.
Where you wanted to be?
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
How old were you?
The exotic women.
Why?
The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
Yes.
Why?
Nothing.
You were there?
Oh.  What do you think about?
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
Book.  Sunglasses.  Great.
How was the beach?
Taiwan.
But he won't shoot you right then?
That means you won't have a gun.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
You killed him here?  In this city, outside that bank?
Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids.
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
Why?
He believed it all went back to one night, when as a little girl.  I watched my parents have this big fight, really big.  I thought my mother was going to kill my father. Then they went into their room and made up.  And I watched them make love through the keyhole.
That's a ridiculous move.
Yes.
Both.
I'm not sure that I care anymore.
When did it start?
Wait until he is on the stairs.
I'm taking off my mike.
What?
Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
I called because I just want... I need to talk.
Sometimes.
Sure.
You're pretty famous aren't you?
I hope not.
Taken.
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
Yeah.
I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
That's correct.
Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
You're outnumbered Kat two to one, got to go with the majority, that's democracy.
This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
Like Custer huh?
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
No....The Asylum!
Yes, but it suddenly clicked, this is going to be a crazy place and, since the Commies are used to seeking asylum, we can use that in the marketing.
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
Have you ever stolen anything?
Like helping a sick kid?
Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
Stealing's stealing, we might as well get what we need. This'll do for the floor and the walkway too.
Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway.
You're all bloody useless.
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
Holly!
It was all in Czech wasn't it.
Do you want me to see what's on them?
What do you want me to do?
We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
Listen, Doug took the rap for us all so grab your coat 'cause you're going.
What are you talking about?
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
Ooh, well excuse me.
Alright, I'm coming. It's the perfect place Jahn, thanks.
We should go to the Metro it's quicker.
So, we won't be going to London?
I'm sorry about what I said, really I am. Just take me with you, I don't care where.
Yep, it's all yours.
Don't worry. Thanks.
Great....How long will it go for?
Yo, dobree!
How?
You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
I will tell you - within a week I will have the transcript and we can go through it.
Thanks.
Sure!
Good, wait here, it will not take long and then you may go.
Working....Under cover.
But I have to finish this....
Maybe it is!
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
I don't think you realise what will happen if those files are made public. The lives of thousands of officers depend on the secrecy of those records, including your own now.
I don't care about Americans. Arrest them all if you have to, but keep those records secret.
We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no.
He wants to show now.
I meant he's a doctor.
Demented.
She's not. She's got her own ideas.
Later.
No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
What kind of a man are you, son?
Can't you have a normal conversation?
My act?!
And you have to meet my father.
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
Could be...
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
Looking for something -- someone.
I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
Thank you. So were you.
What?
That what's happening to you, only faster?
Mars doesn't rise until 2:30
Hoped for it.
Sure.
That what you do?
Yes. I try to keep my power.
I'm not applying to college.
No.
The doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible.  I didn't want anyone being -- weird around me.
I should have told you sooner --
Landon. I can't even do for myself.
I'm supposed to always be alone?
I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
I have expectations, too.
Dad --
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
Materially or spiritually?
In there.
You don't. That's the point.
I beg your pardon?
Fine.
Have we ever met before?
Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
George, if you don't want Chinese food, pick a place you want to go and make a reservation.
Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
March 11th.
That reminds me, if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain, I've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house -- we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater.
Then where the hell is he?
Is Shemp all right?
The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
Ssshhhhh!
Yeah, a shopping mall. You know, a shopping mall?
Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.
Of course! The power converter! It works! Of course, it works...  What chemicals do we use?
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
I brought it with me from 1982. It's from my science book.
But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.
Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.
It's the most beautiful city I've ever seen! What is it?
I run this place! 
Hi, Marty!
He said not to tell.
What's going on?
What do you mean?
Does he bite?
I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.
Then why'd you do it?
Sure thing. Come on.
Sure.
What'd you come out here for?
Yeah. I can imagine.
Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you.  I'll try anything once.  What's your name? I said mine.
What for?
Well, nobody asked me what I thought. They just hung it on me.
Hey, wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?
Can I be honest?
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
Well, that's the point, stupid.
Why?
Yeah, me too.
I never been to Montana... Acquaintance of mine has, but I hadn't... Never had any reason to.
It was going too fast.
Sure.
This your place?
Don't worry, I won't let her drive.
Yes.
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
Git.
Then that's it!
Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.
Have you warned Professor Hikita?
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
He offered you money?
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
Another 'you'?
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
Any time.
She was killed, Penny.
How did she die?  I wanna know.
Go where?  Where're you going?
Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
Why me?
Cause Buckaroo needs me here.
No!  Ditto the professor-
Bet I do.
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
Barton. You see, Barton, I'm not just Bill's secretary – Bill and I are... I love. We-
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his –
What. What don't I understand?
Barton. I'm sorry, it's Barton Fink.
If I can. He gets jealous; he-
What are they like? What are they about?
Bill –
Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 'EM! DROWN –
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
So be it.
What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
Then who should I talk to?
Okay.
Very important, Garland. I just thought you should know that. Whatever happens.
Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game – door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people – that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need – a fella could do worse.
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
Well, I can tell you some stories –
Okay, but hell, you should know what it is. I can show you in about thirty seconds.
That's all right, really –
Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours.
I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I'll miss you.
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
Are you sure –
You gotta believe me –
Yeah, but Charlie –
That's okay, that's okay, that's okay – that's just fine. You probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. We're only interested in one thing: Can you tell a story, Bart?  Can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? Is that more than one thing? Okay.  The point is, I run this dump and I don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit. Showmanship. And also, and I hope Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. Did you tell him that, Lou? And I don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing – although, you're the writer, you would know more about that. Coffee?
Lou.
I apologize, Barton.
I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.
Would that be good enough for ya?
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
Were you drinking?
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.
It's been three months.
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
Thank you.
Yes.  I care about you.  I did it for you.
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking him.
Yes.
Was there anyone with you last night?
Are you arresting me?
I have nothing to hide.
Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew.
I told you I had a vivid imagination.
Did you like her to watch?
No more games, Nick.  I'm tired of playing games!
Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
Did you miss me?
What are you researching?
Really.  What are you writing about.
Did you ever tie him up?
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
What was the weapon?
Were there ever any suspects?
Was his wife ever a suspect?
He had a girlfriend?
Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
Not now he don't.
Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.
You don't like punk rockers?
I know what happened.  Catherine told me what happened.
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --
Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
It's yours.
I don't know.
I haven't decided yet.  Rene, you wanna come over to the studio tomorrow. I wanna make a painting of you.
See ya in an hour.  So what do you think?
I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
New York.
Ten bucks apiece.
You think those are good presents? Who wants an old wig?
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
That would be a pity because you're a real painter.
How much for these five?
You name it, I paint there.
How do you know?
That's the same guy who did this painting.
It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.
OK. I'll be at your studio Thursday three o'clock.
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
No, I'm Haitian-Puerto Rican.
Who said that?
OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work?
Use your fucking instinct.
Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you.
The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic – writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are..
We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist – she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
So then what?
Good. What do you have?
'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?'
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
I'm going to my parents this weekend. What am I going to wear?  How could you do that to me?
What who's saying?
You're back.
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
I'm your family.
Staten Island would be ok.
Think so?
George?
Yeah, it's the best one.
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
Forget it.
Yeah.
I sculpt. I'm really just starting to find myself. How old are you? Twenty? You're just like I used to be. I'm forty-one. And I'm glad I haven't gotten any recognition. It gave me time to develop.
I need this?
No, nothing, ah ...  His parents ... I ... I hope he finds them.
I think I'll take the stairs.
I'm -- sorry, I --
We do.
Wrong on both counts.
I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
-- and it's gonna be a hot time in the cold town tonight.
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
Nor I, on the second.
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
One way to find out?
You're quick.  Mayor Cobblepot.
My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
Too good?
I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.
Why, yes, actually.  Death and chance stole your parents.  But rather than become a victim, you have done everything in your power to control the fates.  For what is Batman if not an effort to master the chaos that sweeps our world, an attempt to control death itself.
It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.
Just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus.
Mr. Freeze.
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
Me too.  Great stems, though.
Can he save her?
Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
Bruce?  What are you doing?
Well...um...her.
You were right.  I get it.  You're not the marrying kind.  You've made your point.  Goodbye Bruce Wayne.
Somehow he survived.  But the cryoslution mutated his body.
I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?
I'm scared, Dick.  Maybe for the first time in my life.  I'm really scared.
Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
And she did it all for me.  For love.
I'm hungry.  I think I'll have poultry.
Not good.
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
Without your research, I could never have come this far.  Join me.  The two of us, entwined, side by side...
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
I don't know, sir. Your dear parents.  Suddenly gone. So much loss...
Which `they' might that be, sir?
Why, indeed?
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
Recognition, of course.
How ya doin', Al?
I don't mind the work. Pity I can't see behind the mask.
Exactly!
Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
Banzai.
Wacko? That a technical term?
That's usually my line.
Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
But...
Sorry. I haven't even had time to unpack. Instant coffee okay?
Why do I feel like the other man, here?
What?
I'm not-
I don't want to remember!
What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say?
What are you talking about?
Excuse me.
What I do isn't about revenge.
You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be.  What do you think of my new invention?
Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?
Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
Just call us Harvey. Can we get you a sandwich? A soft drink? Given all the trouble we caused you, how about we cut you in for a share of tonight's haul?
Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
Too many people. Come on!  SHIELDS!!
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
How do I know you won't keep them all?
No. Every product contains one component. The elements react in combination. Hair spray won't do it. But hair spray and perfume and lipstick will.  Untraceable. It's very elegant.
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
Alfred, bring something for Mr. Knox -- I'll have one, too.
Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.  And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio.  Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.
Mm-hmm.  Lunch.  Not even dinner.
... Looks like a convention.
No one would miss me.
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
... Behind the makeup?
He's not crazy.
You okay?
Your face smells like a foot.
David, I'm serious!
I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days.
Now what does that mean?  My daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing?  That tie's God-awful.  Why do you wear it?
Hi.....  Roses.
Sort of half.....
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
Yes, this is Doctor Bean.
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
Sean Connery.
Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside.  No-one's asking you to go to bed with him.
Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that.
Great, good.
Bye, Bean.  Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?  I know it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.
You know the thing I hate most about children?
You.
The TV.
Huh huh. This says Beavis.
And Boot-Head.
Heh heh. This is the best night of our lives.
Yeah, heh heh, enough'a this crap.
Cool! Huh huh huh.
Uh...
Okay. I'll go right after you.
Uh, oh yeah. Cool. They can take us to Washington and we can finally score.
Oh yeah,...I mean no. NO! I won't settle down! Not this time!...
Uh... butt-snatch...
Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have a drink on it.
Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
Well, if you find yourself getting tired, take a couple of these.
Uh, we didn't score yet.
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
We've run a sample through the National Criminal Sperm Bank and come up with two possible genetic matches for a father. 
Where did these guys come from?
D.C., Chief.
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
Bork, when this is all over, remind me to make you an appointment with Agent Hurley.
Where are his pants?
She sure does.
So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
Let's not think about it.  We'll have a nice romantic, quiet, vacation.  Here comes the bridge chorus.
Two hours.
What?
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
At least we won't have to worry about her.
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
That's all we need.
No.  But it's somewhere without big worms.
Think of them as death shrouds. And the moaning is important. Really <u>moan</u>!  Practice, practice, practice.
Of course I did.
Then it should be here.
<u>Betelgeuse</u>!
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
But <u>we</u> let him out.
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
Just a hunch.
All right.
We were trying to scare your mother.
I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.
<u>Out</u>.
We're...
Hey <u>you've</u> been on Saturn!  I <u>hate</u> those sandworms!  <u>Yecchhh</u>! I've lost a lot of buddies to sandworms.  So a daughter?  She got good legs? God I love a young leg.
Home.  <u>Home</u>.  <u>Home</u>!
What do you expect?  You're dead.
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
Are you a spirit too?
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
Stepmother.
Otho, could you actually... do something with them?
They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.
Joke!  Joke!  Aspirin!  It doesn't matter what brand.
Shhhh.  They didn't commit suicide.
Viridian?
Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
Probably the world's largest <u>Reader's</u> <u>Digest</u> collection!  C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.
Yes. I think so, too.
It's fine today, Robert.
Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.
Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
Yes, I suppose that's true.
Yes, Robert - I am.  I'll go tell Eve about Ben now, Robert.
Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
He's resting comfortably now. There's no cause for alarm, yet...
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
Very well... Can we rule out inefficiency...?
Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.
Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
I agree.
Yes.
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
Yes. Are you going to leave and close the house when he dies?
Good night, Eve.
Hello, Eve.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
How is Ben feeling?
That's good. I like to watch, too.
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
... I have very few friends, Chauncey... And Benjamin's friends are all quite a bit older...
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
No, Eve. I like you to be here.
Yes, Eve. I know that.
Hello, Dennis.
It must be the punch, and it is stuffy in here -- I feel it a little myself. You're an angel, my dear - thank God there are still men like you around to give aid and comfort.
Yes. It's very good, Eve.
Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.
Yes, very well, thank you.
Really? Really!!!
We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
Now, wait a minute, Chauncey you are young, you are healthy, for God's sake don't give up on yourself! You have to fight! You can't let those bastards keep you down! I don't want to hear any more from you about the 'Room Upstairs'. That's where I'm going soon.
Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
... Oh?  Robert, take a look, would you?
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
A flower...
Hello, Ronald.
Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this way, sir.
Yes. Of men and women.
No.
No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
I agree.
Very good.
Is his back feeling better?
Yes, I'm very hungry.
I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
No. I don't object.
Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
I see...
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.
Good. That's good. Then if you would please sign a paper to that effect.
I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave...  Call me if you change your mind about signing.  C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...
Now, Ben, did you happen to get a chance to...
Wonderful, we'll all look forward to seeing you.  Is Eve around? I'd like to say hello.
Try again.
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
I'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg, Mr. Gardiner.
Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think...
Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
So...? Where the hell is it?
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
Mr. Gardiner...
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
Malkovich!
What?
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
Why?
Don't crowd me, Craig.
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
You've always hated the animals.
Shut up!
Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
I love you so much.
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
Yes?
Yex?
I said "yes."
I am a trained performer.
Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and....
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
No, really.
Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
Don’t let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
You're a fag or a liar.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Good. We'll sell tickets.
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
Hush, sweetheart.
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
No. Don't be an ass.
Can I be anyone I want?
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
Forget it.
Says who?
Do we get to wear a crown?
With immense pleasure, my dear. Down that hall, ninth door on the left. Watch the step down. It's sunken, you know.
I understand, but we must protect the vessel at all costs.  Please, Craig, please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours.
Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
What's the play?
Who's calling?
Whatever you're having.
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
Vegas. Can you arrange that?
Sleepy suddenly.
What want ye, girl child?
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
Say the Word!
Was a time I knew what was.
I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D.
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
Yes ma'am..
Be here. In case.
In case the house burn down or bad weather slops the roads so bad I can't get here on time or late guests needed cleaning up after. Anything.  Don't ask me what whitefolks need at night.
No. I mean work work.
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
Might see anything at all at 124.
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
Her who?
Girl, give it up! We been friends too long to act like this.
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
You planning to do anything about it?
Oh yeah. I got big plans.
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
Huh.
Well Dude, we just don't know.
Oh, nothin', you know.
Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw shit.  We got a nice quiet beach community here, and I aim to keep it nice and quiet.  So let me make something plain.  I don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk- off name, I don't like your jerk-off face, I don't like your jerk- off behavior, and I don't like you, jerk- off --do I make myself clear?
NO RULES!  YOU CABBAGE-EATING SONS- OF- BITCHES--
Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.
Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
Walter, how--
What--
What's that, Walter?
Where's your car, Dude?
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
Nancy's pretty good.
Are these.
And what do you do, sir?
Separate incidents?
Thankie. . . Just one thing, Dude. D'ya have to use s'many cuss words?
Yeah.  Thanks man.
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
Yeah man.
Thank you.
Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
You're not interested in sex?
Take a look at this, sir.
Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. I asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this "abduction", but I tell you it is preposterous.  This compulsive
She most certainly was not!
Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  You might learn something.  Now I got--
From who?
Well...yeah--
I want you to see him immediately.
Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
But he's--
Well...no, of course not--
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
No, but--
Yeah, but--
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!
Am I wrong!
Just, just take it easy, Walter.
The man is a sex offender.  With a record.  Spent six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight- year-old.
It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin said, look for the person who will benefit.  And you will, uh, you know, you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying to say--
The fucking point is--
It's your roll.
Okay Dude.  Have it your way.
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
What the fuck?
Walter, please--
And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car?
Whose toe was it, Walter?
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
What about the toe?
FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Uh-huh.
The bulk of the series.
Uh-huh.
And the fucking money!
Dude?
It is a fucking emergency.
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
WALTER, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WE GOTTA GO TO PASADENA!  COME  PICK ME UP OR I'M OFF THE FUCKING BOWLING TEAM!
I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
Sure, I'll put him down, Dude.  RAUSS! ACHTUNG, BABY!!
Yeah, I can see that, Dude.
That's fuckin' combat.  The man in the black pyjamas, Dude.  Worthy fuckin' adversary.
AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!
No Dude.
Wha.
Wha. . . Donny--
Hurry Dude.  I'd go but I'm pumping blood.  Might pass out.
The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.
A hundred and eighty dollars?!
Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
They did not receive the money, you nitwit!  They  did not receive the goddamn money.  HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR HANDS!
I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS!
I said out.  Now.
A world of pain.
All right!  There it is!  It's fucking zero!
Someday.
No.  They've been training to hunt you.
I haven't forgotten.
Nothing.
I don't understand.
I don't like it.
I'll show you.
It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to anger --  You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards.  Where'd they get their intel?
Where the hell have you been?
For what?
Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece. The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.  Like you.  Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.
Any casualties?
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
Nope.  Back then we did not.
You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
The vampire God. This speaks of His return.
How do I stop it?
Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
For some. Live forever, never get old. The ultimate high.
We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
No --
Then what is it?
Why should I respect something which has outlived its purpose?
LaMagra --
Go on, I'll be fine!
The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control.  The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure --
What happened to her, where did she go?
Inside the grave?
--Christ almighty--
Domini. Domini Von Teer.
What is <u>this</u>?
Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
Anna--
I want to see the tapes.
Whatever you want.
Why?
Beta Cam's still coming back tomorrow, right?
Yeah.
Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We're both in a world of shit here!!
I want amphetamines.
Sometimes.
No.
That's what Josh and Mike said.
Hadn't even opened the thing since Cub scouts.
Too busy eating us?
I spend a lot of time on e-Bay. Buying, selling--sometimes buying then re-selling at substantial mark-up, sometimes just selling crap I find in the street.
Down there in the Park.
--one of us, all of us--I have no idea--brought whatever this thing is back here. We're not going to go out there and spread it around like Typhoid Mary. We're gonna figure it out, we're gonna bring a goddamn <u>end</u> to it.
No one ever comes here.
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
--turn the goddamn camera off!
I am.
<u>Now</u> you can bring the vehicle to a stop: there on the left.
At least you still have the tapes.
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
There is something <u>there</u>--don't ask, just trust me.
Still working on it.
Get some more beer.
That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
I'm sorry.
You <u>know</u> what we picked up in the woods--
His daughter, for God's sake-- I need to know if he's heard from her this morning.
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
Well I do...
You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there.
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
Door's locked. Nothing there.
...Huh?
Yeah, he told me once himself. He said to me...
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
Ray?... What time is it?
I don't know. It's early... I love you.
Yeah.
...What was that?
Marty.
With your gun?...
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
What's the matter?
You owe me for two weeks.
Most of the night...
Got a job for you.
I didn't say that.  Well?
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
Yeah, well, I may be getting in over my head here, I mean you're the geologist, but my theory for what it's worth, you got all these volcanoes and each time one pops it's the equivalent of what, twenty, thirty megatons of TNT?  Enough to light Las Vegas for how long?  How many years? Course, I'm no mathematician but--
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
Anything you can tell me?
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Yes sir.
From the neighborhood?  Shut the fuck up.  You like telephones? Huh?. You wanta go for a ride?
You want to see him too, right?
Then, shut up!
Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  . Hey, pretty, pretty.
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.
You said hello. to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone?. Don?. and little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. and something about a Meadow Lane. something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
THEN WHAT?
What?
Frank? .can you stand up?
Falling.
Frank is coming?
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
Yes.
No. not really.  but also because I really want you to be alright.
It's okay. it's okay.
Who, Dorothy?
Don. help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
Nothing.
There ya go.
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
Still, it must be kinda rough.
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
I'll drink to that.
Why not?
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean?
No way. I'm about to blow up.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
See ya tomorrow.
Jeffrey!!
You like mysteries that much?
Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you. very much.
... You look beautiful.
Let's wait for some slow one.
Okay.
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Do you want the car?
Would you like a piece of cake?
Anyone else?. Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
Okay.
He what?
Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you.  I don't think there will be a problem.
You'll see for yourself.
Derek!
Yeah.  I am.
Are you kidding?
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up like us.
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
The coca is my responsibility!
No.
Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies.
Not bad for a weekend's work, huh?
What?
Not really, no.
Ah, yes.  The murder.
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?
Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you accomplish your dream.  But yet you failed.  Why?
Because they caught me?
Oh my G-d.
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
George, hallo!  Today is the day, ah? Are you out?
How are we doing?
Slow down, George.  Slow down.
Yes.  Look around you.  The sun.  The water.  The women.  It's better than Danbury, no?  Come on.  I have some friends I would like you to meet.
Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.
Just a friend.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.
I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What happened to our dream?
Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas campesinos?
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
Coke.
Oh, shut up, Fred.  Shut your big fat mouth.  You don't buy it all at once. It's called layaway.
Actually, it was three.
I want money.
Yeah.
Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
I see.  I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus is.
You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
Of course, George.  We are beautiful. We are brothers.  Real brothers.  Not like Diego.  We started this, George.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
No, Dad.  I don't want to...I mean, I just don't want...
You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
No.
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
Figured what out?
You know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money?  Being how we don't want to get jobs and whatnot? Well, check this out.
Tuna.
Holy shit, Dulli.  What the hell are you doing here?
She did that before.
I said, I've seen it before.
Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
What?
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
Yeah.
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
I don't want, alright?  It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew it, now leave me alone.
Yes, I do.
Yes, I am.
Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand dollars, and I have no more concerns.
No, man.  I'm too fucked up.
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance.
The NLF has condemned you to death.
I don't even know your name yet ...
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
Not enough.
Of course. As soon as possible.
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
A name?
I'm sorry, man -- but I ain't ever heard of no brother dying from gettin' too much pussy.
She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty slick.
An inquiry into what?
What induced it?
Yes.
It would be an added stress to his heart.
Sex.
Sit down, Frank.
No.  Miss Lawson came in here voluntarily to answer your questions. She doesn't have to sit here and be insulted.  So, either you charge her now or we're leaving.
She planned this.  She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
Your Honor -- please!
Why did you come by?
Yes.
We were lovers.
I had bypass surgery.
Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
Well -- I think that after the operation she realized that...
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
It was like sex was a game to her. She got off on the control.  She always used to tell me it had to be her way.
She's a woman who is very much aware of her own sexuality.  Sometimes I felt she could read my mind.  It was uncanny how she knew exactly what I wanted.  A few nights before my heart surgery Rebecca woke me.  She had handcuffed me to the bed.
I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
Did you change your will while you were with Miss Lawson?
Yes -- several times.
Yes -- Insulin and others.
Yes.
No.
You called him?
No.
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
No.  No, I don't.
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
No.
High school?
Yes.
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
How?
Do you remember his exact words?
I don't know.  It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.
I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking.  I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find their little toys all over the place.
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
That bastard!
She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.
Yes.
No.
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
What do you think I've got?  A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.
And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?
You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
Why didn't you live together?
No -- it just doesn't look right.
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
You and me -- making love.
No -- that's what I know you were thinking.
What?
Paley could be a problem tomorrow.
I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
No -- you're not.
How's it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me.  After that I figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in.  That you were crazed because we humiliated you in court?
Don't listen to him.  Can't you see he's trying to turn you against me.
Why?
I gotta go.  I'll call you later.
I can think of worse ways to go--
Yes.
It's bad enough that you are.  It's even worse that you can stand here and lie to me.
What time did you leave?
Then we should have had lunch at the bank.
Well, that's a long time.
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
Well, there's a problem.
What?!
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
Nobody did.
Was this during Betty?
Heat is heat.
That's it.
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
Oh.
Yeah.
No, I'm not.  I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just...  Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
I found this Chicago station before. Wait a minute...  Here it is.
Sure.
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
I don't think you're normal.
What?
Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
But no one in particular.
No. But I love them just the same.
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
I understand.  That's very kind of you.
Oh, how is he?
Have you ever been to that station?
Why?
Nobody's asking you to.
I sat outside and had coffee.
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
How do you know what I experience?
Yeah. It could get better.
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
Nah.
What's her name?
Well, that's crazy. I don't know anybody who gets cremated.
I know damn well she's there.
I don't.
Nothing.  Contact paranoia.  Must be buggin' from hanging with you.
Well, go find his lazy ass.  I scratch any more tonight I'm gonna have carpal tunnel syndrome.
You wouldn't know a mule if it bit you in the ass. And personally, I don't need a mule.  I got a Lexus.  And nobody gave it to me --
Yeah, and it took some doing to get out of there.  Just be glad I did and you can start life from here instead of down there.
Bones.
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
That place is already bad luck.
Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.
Patrick, he's...
I can't!
You got the shit?
I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
Bullshit!  Bullshit!!  You're selling it back!  That's an order!
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
12-year olds.  They scare easy.  Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash.  Come with me.
Get that car the hell away from here, now!  I spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool.  But this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off.
Maybe I oughta open a couple holes in that head and let all them voices out. You'll feel better, I promise.
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
Know what?
I think you're fucking crazy!
The money!
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
But it could be anywhere.
This is insane!
The hell I can't!
No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.
Just hurry.
Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.
Another time.
No.
Sure, Mickey.  Sure.
Hey, Mickey.
Good.  Sit tight.  I'll call you.
Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
This is the police, ma'am.
That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
Truck.  Of course.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
I wanted to apologize.
I'm already in your bed.
What are you afraid of?
I don't understand - ?
I know!  You can't understand, because we're different, Violet.  We're different.
You mean Shelly?
That's what he told himself.  But it wasn't even about me, it was about Caesar.  He wanted what Caesar had. That's how they are.  I understand them.
Like each other?  They hate each other.
Who is Gino?
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
Violet?
We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone?
Yes.
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
We're exploring <u>every</u> possibility.  We are in pursuit.  How much more do you want me to tell you?
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
What is Treadstone?
Yes, I'm here...
It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
What are you talking about?
I was shot twice in the back.
People do amazing things when they're scared.
I can't believe I slept.
Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
I trusted you.
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone.
Nykwana Wombosi. 
Yes.
Think I could rent a scooter?
Shit, we didn't sign in.
So get the hell out of here.
-- here we go -- I found it --
Get everyone down in the basement.
What's that?
-- I'm on it --
-- he accessed the account --
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  It's clean.
No.
...ditioning.
...aven't you?
... get to it.
Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
Oh, right ...
Layton.
In fact, killing people -
- In fact, killing people - they'd get a lot more out of life.
Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
No, no ... I did that...
You sound worried.
What?
Not really, no.
Christ! You do know it all!
No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.
Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
You're the only person I can trust.
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
Say it was a mistake.
She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong.
Well, could you stay away from me until this thing blows over.
Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice?
You think these are tits don't you?
Please!
What?
What parcel?
Looking for you.
Who will?
Turn!
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
It's not our mistake!
Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
You want to take my console into your office?
Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.  You seem to have quite a lot to do yourself. 
A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so.  Monsieur?
No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he's got the ambition. You haven't got the ambition but luckily you've got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann was very close -
It's something for executives.
Not now ... please
Um ...
Shirley and I come here regularly. I love romantic lingerie.
Numero deux, duck a l'orange. 
No need, sir
I don't know which numero.
Madam ... CUT to WOMAN turning, half in flirtatious conversation. It is SAM's MOTHER, but miraculously another twenty years younger and ... a parody of SAM's Dream Girl.
Have you got one or haven't you?
It's all right, Terry, it's all right, everything's all right.
It's a 27B/6, what did you think it was?
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
He's not a cop, he's a medic.  I'm CY Coates.
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
Dead.
No.
No, no medicine!
Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?
Yes.
Our Lady of Misery.
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
I think it looks good.
You can't kill my father that easy. He'll fight forever. Like with me: hasn't talked to me in three years. But it's okay. Sometimes you have to put things behind you.
We moved out after that. Upstate.
I think I'd remember that.
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone else has.
No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap.
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
She loves me the way no woman ever has.
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
What's wrong.
It's coming.
What look?
Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto.
C'mon, look at your screen. Give up some blood!
Relax, will you.
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
You're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do.
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
Why?  What did they do to you?
I'm going to miss you -- you're a prick in a great way...
Yes.
Yes.
Sure.
Eleven and a half.
Of course.
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
Do you feel good about it?
Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.
Speaking.
Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
Outside?
Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
It depends on how big a news day it is.
Uh-uh.  I'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though.
Oh, come on -- tell us another.
My gosh, and for a while there, I was attracted to you.
I'll speak to you soon
I'll be right down.  It's right tight.
I'll never tell.
I liked it.  He's not afraid to be human.
And Bobbie says...
We could...
No, I don't think so.
How do I get out of here?
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
Nobody else had it.
What do you mean?  You're one of the few people in this town I can talk to.
Oh.
No.  I'm doing fine...Look.
Go ahead.
It's not.
Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.
I agree with you -- you're not qualified.  So get qualified.  You can insist on being better prepared.  You don't have to just leave it as...  'I don't write.  I'm not schooled. I don't understand the news I'm reading. But at least I'm upset about it, folks.'
How's it going?
Okay.
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
I'll wait for you till seven.
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
Why, you need me for the story?
Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.
Oh, good.
This is hysterical.
What?
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
A picnic?
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
The way you were looking at me, I just went.
Uh-huh.
You're breaking my concentration!
Whaddya mean?
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
Honest?
Me too.
Now you're a professional!
I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
Yes Walter.
Every word...
Oh sure, let's string along poor Walter, see how far it will take us!
Is it?  I've forgotten.
It was.
Why don't you cover it up, Walter!
Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.
I know.
But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!
No man I'm on my own plane.
Maxwell gave him a bottle of wheat germ oil.  Maybe he started taking it.
Yeah.
Well it sure looks dead enough.
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
Good night Walter.
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
Yeah, why?
Well, w-what did you do?
What offers have you got for it? I won't be out-bidded.  I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want.
What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand?
Oh yeah that was Mayolia, she's a nice girl.  She's kind of strange, though.
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
I worked in one of them.  Back in Alaska. 
Yes, get rid of them...
Your work, the layers of irony.
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
No... Not a boy...  Find out if they're dead.  And do something about that arm.  Honestly, I don't know how you made it through the Crusades.
Coach knows what abs are?
Andy!
Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.
No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
Nothing.
You want some water or something?
Yeah.
Mmkay.
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
You're the boss, boss.  I just thought maybe we should wait.
I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
I forgot.
Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
Oh my God you're having an affair.
This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
Lothos.
All right.  What do we do now?
She --
There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
Here?
Okay.
Last night.  You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?
Don't start with me again.
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
What did you think, that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a Slayer?
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.
They don't even have Dolby.
Cassandra's really smart.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
Thanks.
My parents have money...
Really?
What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
Could be.
Oh, baby!
Jeffrey!
Throw it out.
Right.
As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends?
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
I don't think so.
You said "Crash".
You see how nice things are when we go slow?
You can learn to like it.
Gimme the God damn ball!
Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
Get over here.
I'll tuck you in.
Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
I'm trying to play with your body!
Oh--won't YOU come in?
You don't have to...
How can I possibly thank you?
"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
I don't dance.
I want to be had.
I want you desperately!
I heard already.
It doesn't work like that.  God, you're gorgeous.  Want to dance?
What?
It says he's not bending his back on his follow-through.
We were worried that Ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball--we're so pleased, he met a Christian woman.
You a God damn witch?
You spit on me!
I didn't spit on you!
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
"To announce your fucking presence with authority"?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.
Why's he always call me "Meat"? I'm the guy driving a Porsche.
Well, I held it like an egg.
He did know.
What do I got?
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries--and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am.
I won't have to.
Annie's a smart lady.
Yep.  He really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
What do I gotta do?
Yep.  So how's Annie?
You know what the difference Is between hitting .250 and hitting .300?  1 got it figured out.  Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at bats is 50 points.  Okay?  There's 6 months in a season, that's about 25 weeks--you get one extra flare a week--just one--a gork, a ground ball with eyes, a dying quail-- just one more dying quail a week and you're in Yankee Stadium!
Fear and ignorance.
You too...Meat.
Love to--
No way.
It's a damn easy thing to play with.
Can I give you my testimony?
Okay...
I put in a word for you with the organization--told 'em I thought you'd make a fine minor league manager someday...Might be an opening at Salem next year--
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?!
He's lying.
They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
Yeah.
Hold on a second.
Look, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing.  Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. Okay?
I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
You got it.  Schmuck.  All right. I just bought us a few minutes. Want to get back at this prick?
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
Wh-wh -
Oh, no, please, please.
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
No.
Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.
I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.
Listen...
Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
My wife?
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
Yeah, that's right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams. I'm gonna have to straighten out what you just did with this guy.
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me!  That's the only reason!  Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [Skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass! Then where you gonna go?!  You're fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again! You motherfucker, you!
Well...
I'll be right there.
No problem.  Sorry.
Well, that's why they paid so well.
Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -
You've got to stop her.
What can I do?
No, Ace.
...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
Here we go. Good luck.
Right away. Okay?
Hello.
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
She could be the most charming woman you ever saw. People loved to be around her.
Who's fighting? I mean, I'm, you know, tell me what it's for.
No.
If not for me, at least for Amy.
No, you don't.
What do you mean?
Mm-hm.
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.
You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch.
I am not!
Let me in the house! Fucker!
You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
...and hypocrisy.
Bullshit! Bullshit!
...twenty years in order to find nothin' on me -
What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?
Listen, if you didn't know you're bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job. If you did know, you were in on it. Either way, you're out!  Get out! Go on.  Let's go.
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
No, Sir.
Ye-yeah.
Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
Yeah.
Get out of here.
...I got muscled on the street.
Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
Hey.
Pitch-black?! It -
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
Fuckers!
Carmine's gone.
Oh.
Carmine left?
Calm down! Calm down!
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
How are you?
I'll take care of it, Remo.
What're you gonna do?
Of course, Remo.
What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.
So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
Hm.
He's good. He's fine.
Mm.
Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
I can see that. Sure.
Mm, you want to steal it? 
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
Yeah.
Bye.
Nothin'.
Yeah?
Yeah, right. That's Sammy. And he's probably got it there too.
Yes, you did.
He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
Exactly.  He hates me.
I need some help. I do. I need some help.  You gotta help me. I need a new sponsor, Nicky.
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
Here.
They check in alone?
'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
Hold it, hold it. Here.
Every night, on the couch.
This is Nick.
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
No, no, no, no!
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
How you doin'?
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
You're a little confused?
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
I'm sorry.
Again!
That's enough.
...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
You'll get a heart attack like that.
Why don't I take him over to the office and verify it, huh?
Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland...  Can I get my winnings?
I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
It's okay. Let her go.
This looks promising...
You say that like an amnesia victim.
Guilty. I am.
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
Are you sure?
What did you say?  Selina, sit down, the entire city is going crazy...You have to just calm down...
Can I just say what a classy touch the neon urinals are, Mr. Architect?  I just love risking electrocution every time I..
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
Your uniform, that first time I saw you, was a ghastly cage I vowed to unlock in order to..
Did you ever think that maybe neither of us is Captain God?
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
What do you want from me?
Well then, let's agree to disagree...Now how about a picture for my scrapbook?
What about "climbing in?"
I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
I know.
A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke.
My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
Do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid?  Zilcho. Urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law. Not exactly the stuff of a W-2 form.  If it wasn't for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical "missions"...There is no such thing as heroes and villains, anymore, Selina.  There are only winners and losers. You lost. We won.
"Save the City?" I don't want to save the city, I want to move!  Listen, I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie, but..
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
Did you just say "girls?"
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
Uh. "Thanks?"
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
Like you don't know...
It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
The kicks..the rush..you mean, like pulling heists..faking your own deaths..killing innocent bystanders...like Mexican angels.  I know you're a woman. Do you?
I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open!
I want the gun emptied.  I want to see all six slugs tossed up here. And then I want out.  That's all. <u>OUT</u>!
You never miss a trick.
That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
I improved on the fucking original.
Satisfied, Wiseass?
Sure -- and they record your voice.  And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. That's out!
What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
Oh won't I?
Where'd they take you to?
Elliot -- our driver.  The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired.  It was so quick.
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
She would if she heard my voice on the phone.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.  Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
Shit, stop with the money!  I never asked for a nickel.  I was just doing this.  And you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
That's not her.
No.
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
The one in Brentwood.
What bank?
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
I can't do it.
Why didn't you just shoot them?
You're going to let them get away with this?
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!
You knew about me.
You wouldn't --
I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
How about "later?"
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
That's a reasonable possibility.
Naturally.
Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
-- The phones, Theo.  Don't leave any of them behind.  The cops could pull up a record of all our calls and -- find you.
I told you ... sooner or later you'd have to trust me ...
Who is this?
I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
Twenty percent.
Sure.
Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.
You'll see her.
It's in the process.
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
There's two police cars now.
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
Take the 405 south.
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
Are you busting my chops or what?
Seems not.
Doesn't everybody?
Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.
Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up?
She's not a girl, Col --
Whatever you say.
Did he?
What you think?
Saw it, Dil.
Cunt.
No, of course not, she's a lady.
What?
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
In a way.
Not English.
And what's it like?
Who's she?
Don't know. Who is she?
Yes, thank you.
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
What look?
They're jealous.
I'm not on my own, am I?
Tried to. Sit down, will you?
How different?
Are you jealous of him?
Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool.
What do you think?
You say that like a gentleman.
Did he dance with you?
Tell him it hurt --
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
I know that.
How?
Know what, honey?
Kind of wish I didn't.
You can always pretend.
Are you pretending yet?
Please, Jimmy.
I miss you, Jimmy.
You could say that.
More than that.
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
Okay.
Stop it, Dil --
Just don't kick Dil and she'll be touched. Be nice to her and she'll be yours forever.
Love me.
Yeah.
I'd do anything for you, Dil.
Yes.
Can't remember...
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
He's all right.
Doesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover the fucker up.
I heard.
Suits you.
Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
Get that thing off me, Fergus --
So?
You're on duty. Keep your fucking mouth shut. Go in and get some sleep.
Good. I was beginning to have my doubts about you for the last few days.
You sure about that?
I know that.
And who is she?
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
Right.
Yeah.
So I've noticed.
Kill me.
She's a friend of mine
Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar. I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe I'll get to understand.
You could have said no.
I'll bear that in mind.
Why?
Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
What?
Stop it --
What?
When I was a child...
I said you bastard -- stop --
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
You didn't?
And you know what?
You shut your face --
Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
Lord, you're stubborn.
Yes, you told me.
With whom? Where?
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
All right, prove it to me -- tell me to go to the Embassy first thing in the morning and turn in those stamps.
I heard you, I heard you.
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --
Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite late.
Charles Lampert's widow -- yes?  Last time I sent out a tie only the spot came back.
You mean spies and things like that?
May I have a sandwich, please?
Very sweet.
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Ours.
Because they're still here.
Oh.
Who?
Dead? Mr. Bartholomew -- maybe you'd better tell me what this thing's all about.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
Oh. Then who's this one?
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
Next, please.
Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ?
I said with the mouth shut.
But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
Your --
How can I? You lied to me -- the way Charles did -- and after promising you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe you, Peter... oh, but I can't call you that anymore, can I? It will take me a while to get used to your new name -- which I don't even know yet. What is it?  Aren't you going to tell me?  Hello -- ?
Scobie?
Come on -- I've got something that stings like crazy.
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
Reggie -- listen to me --
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
I think I love you, Alex --
Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
I don't know -- it depends on whether or not they've already eaten.
He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
No.
You're a big help. Can I have one of those?
Why?
I'm sorry.
Shut the door!
I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
No -- he's not the same. Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. Adam Canfield is a crook. And with all the advantages you've got -- brains, charm, education, a handsome face --
What's its value today?
In human life? In greed? In suffering?
The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Félix -- are they for sale now?
I am a tradesman, Madame, not a doorman. And don't forget these.
Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
She isn't going to be anybody's mother unless you answer some questions.
I'm very cold.
I know.  I'm sorry.
It is all right.
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
I don't know -- how would I know?
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
Shakespeare never said that.
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
Are you in the book?
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
Doing what?
Come on. You can't stay here.
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only --  only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending. Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do?
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
You mean you and me?
I don't think I follow you.
That's what I'm not supposed to say.
What was it?
That's all.
So they think he left it with you.
But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
What are you talking about?
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
Come on now -- sure you do. An' you'd better give it to me, Miz Lampert -- cuz I ain't foolin'. No sireebob!
But that is no reason to get a divorce!
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
A fortune! Hurry -- we've got to find him!
Yeah? What's that?
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.
WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
Your mind is just twisted enough. I believe you'd do all this just to get a dip or two.
Don't flatter yourself. You'll be lucky to last ten seconds with me Ben.
But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
So?
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
Better than a pile of dead teenagers.
Calm down Brent.
How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
You are upset.
She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.
The same type that decides to carve into her stomach.
Should we close down any eruption?
Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
You eventually have to talk to him.
You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now.
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
I doubt it. Who'd want to fuck her. She probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties.
He says he loves me.
NO?!
Mark invited me to the party.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
You heard about that?
Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.
No.
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
Did Sharon say no?
I do not.
Pretend we're just another couple.
I need to ask you something.
What?
Not that I know of.
I'm not leaving. I want to know why you and dad are so freaked out. Three of my classmates are dead.
They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
And the police did nothing?
Are you Jody?
Told you to hide it.
But you don't really mean it.
You're being unfair.
Okay, okay.
INT. ANDY'S ICE CREAM FACTORY/STAIRWELL - DAY.
Oh...
Where do you want this stuff?
Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.
I need your truck.

...doing?!
That dog ain't mean.
...fine.
 Shut up.


Hey, take a look at your situation and...
Well, then, that means it's call...
You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--

Oh, shit.

...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!
 Okay.
Come on!
Come on, old...


 Okay.  Okay. 
Okay.  All right.  Okay. 
Taking it down the hill.
Come on!

Oh, shit!
 All right.  Hey.
What?
Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
So I took his truck, yeah.
We were nationally  ranked.
...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
...shit.
 Whoo!
Yeah, I know, I know.
Okay.  All right, man.  Okay.
Arlo!

Come on, come on!
...to him. 
...on!
We've got Elvis!
...here comes the...
What?


Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.


They aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  Arlo. 
Who drove the ice cream...
Who put the big hurt on...
...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
You.
Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, be cool.

I'll keep an eye out.
This country trained me to kill...
Hey!
So...where's my truck?
...take my sorry old truck.
I had no idea how powerful it was.
...here.   Mason... 
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
Bullshit.  Put the phone down, Mason.
In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...
Any of them Richard Long?
...-tor Long.
Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?
The NSA thinks the UN is onto your work...
...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.
Let's proceed.

...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
Almost quaint.
...happen if I drop this?
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
...here!
EXT. DAM - DAY.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
We're in.
...general store.
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
They'll get a break tomorrow.
Quite a getup for jacking...
I beg your pardon?
...Long.
...your concern nor your fight.  Relinquish the package and you can go.
I don't know what the hell...
...to die for a country that's...




...-time,  remember?
...-fore he closes, which means you're gonna have to cover the grill and the floor.
Mm.  It doesn't take a genius.
Story of my life.  Well, one thing you won't lose is that friend of yours back there, I'll tell you that.
...now!
Get ready to take it out!

...colonel?
My secret?
...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
Tie a fly...
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
Everything will die, Mason.
And only then does our noble friend realize...
 I don't know.  Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe...another hour?
I got eight thousand yards. Radius is five...
So you don't remember...
Then how about if I call you "ass-...
...we're all gonna die in this...
I'll lead 'em out.
EXT. ICE CREAM TRUCK - DAY.
...-damn phone.
INT. TUNNEL/AIR VENT - DAY.
An honest living.
Well, then, how about a ruler?
Probably.
None.
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
Yeah.
Well, It was about five days ago. You were outside the Pig 'n Whistle and you had one hell of an argument.
What about her?
Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
Oh, my, yes.
Either that or she'll be in jail.
Curly, where's your car?
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
I'll just tell my wife.
That's a filthy habit.
Sue the shit out of 'em.
Not anymore. Oh, some time ago, my late husband owned a good deal of beach property in Long Beach, but we lost it.
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little.
Since I made Lieutenant.
No.
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
Absolutely.
Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
And why's that?
Shut up.  Go on.
Where?
Obviously the fall must have knocked him out.
Now wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray...
That's not his apartment.
Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk.
What?
Look at it this way. Now this phony broad, excuse the language, says she's you, she's hired me. Whoever put her up to it, didn't have anything against me. They were out to get your husband. Now if I see him, I can help him.  Did you talk this morning?
A check?
Well, how much would you like?
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
Did you have affairs?
Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.
You mean you don't know where you were?
I mean I can't tell you.
More like other people putting their business in my nose.
Another satisfied client's wife.
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
Over the water department, or over you?
What? What is it?
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
Get in the car.
You can't always tell what's going on there.
...Yes, sort of a birthmark...
Including the death of your husband?
C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
Aren't you coming back with me?
I want to see her.
What are you saying?
I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
...no...
Katherine.
She's my daughter.
Back to Mexico.
I'm all right.
He's in the dark room.
...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
A Miss Sessions calling.
Oh, good.
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
Never?
What about the water?
Sure you do.
Mr. Gittes...
Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?
...Yes of course.
He's not in, Mr.?
Gittes.
Yes.
How did they get it away from him?
Yes. Yes, they were partners.
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
Sue people like that they're liable to be having dinner with the Judge who's trying the suit.
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the time. Julian Cross' daughter. God almighty. She was a wild little thing.
Why'd she run away?
We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
No...
Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing. 
Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... 
Yes. 
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
Whatever you do, love it like you loved that projection booth of the Paradiso when you were little... 
Father Adelfio, I have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul. And you've got to help me, because I've lost all peace of mind...
Elena. My name's Elena.
Hi. Why are you running?
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
What difference does it make to find an explanation? That's the way it went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, he was the only one who really understood you. Salvatore, if you had chosen to be with me, you'd have never made your films. And that would have been a pity! Because they're wonderful, I've seen them all.  But you shouldn't have gone and changed your name. You should have kept your own.
And I never asked for one! You have nothing to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was that. With no beating around the bush...  Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night...
How are you, Mr. Thatcher?
Please, Mr. Bernstein.
That's a long story.
From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end.  Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
Yes.
Because we're running a newspaper, Mr. Kane, not a scandal sheet.
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
Emily, you're being - a little unfair -  You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives -
Emily, you -
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected.  To start with, I'll break your neck.
What are you waiting here for? Why don't you go?
If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
If you want to come in and wash your face -  I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
I'm sorry.  They live here, too?
No.  But you're close.
Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
Would you sing for me?
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -
I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not.  Let me see -  Mike!
You're right.  We did lose a million dollars last year.
Yes, sir -
Do you know what that is?
People are going to know who's responsible.  And they're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly.  And no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news.
Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
Why is she leaving me?
That's the train with all the lights.
Maybe you could remember something that -
Was he in love?
Turn that thing off, will you?  It's driving me nuts!  What's Rosebud?
What do you mean?
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -
I'll have a highball.
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
I'll just take the gum.
We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
Awww. That was so cute.
It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
You two better quit it.
No.
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
But you were.
What?
I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
Call the police.
Um... I don't know.  What time did hockey end?
Yeah.
Excuse me?
Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass!
We get... what... twelve minutes of game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!  I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.
Go open the sore.
Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
You called Caitlin again?
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
Oh, my God.
Great story, isn't it?
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
Return of the Jedi.
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.
I think they were Catholics.
So they build another Death Star, right?
Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
I'll give him five more minutes then I'm calling the cops. I don't need this, man. I'm not even supposed to be here today.
Can we talk about this later?
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
Veronica!
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
I know.
I'm going to miss the game.
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
We're not playing in the street.
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
No, I'm serious.
Stop it. This is beneath even you.
Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.
He broke his neck trying to suck his own dick.
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
He made it, hunhh?
We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
What?
Not yet. 
Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
What?
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
I know I'm your hero.
Holy shit. That girl?
Watch the store while I go home and change.
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
This life.
It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
Jesus.
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
You need a ride?
Got one. Just pulled up.
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
All right. Good luck with Veronica. If you want, I can talk to her, you know, and explain...
No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
THE GLADES MOTEL?
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you.
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
I don't know. I wasn't watching.
You used to go out with her?
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
Lasagne.
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
Jesus... go ahead.
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
What were you doing?
Oh, be real! Would you... Would you please hug me?  I just went through a very traumatic experience and I haven't been having the best day so far. Now come on.
You're trusting.
Why do you say that?
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
Ooh! Can we?!
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
All right. Name it.
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
You sucked his dick!
Let it go...
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
I feel sick.
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
You couldn't get these shutters open?
What time do you get finished?
And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
It stings a little.
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
I didn't do that!
He's your cousin?
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
That's sick, Dante.
Well, how about these two movies? 
I'm going to have a word with that asshole.
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
That woulda been cool.
Nothing, just tourist souvenirs.
They're about two hundred yards from the top of the tower, right where that ledge comes out, Gabe.
I don't know.
Bags?
Wait 'til you get into trouble, just wait.
Sarah, hold on, he'll have you in a second.  Jesus Christ, grab her!
If you want, do it.  I don't care.
You keep it.  Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him.
Okay--I don't know about this.
Nice and easy...
I'm here!  Sarah, I'm here!  I'm here--I've got you!
Where've you been?
Why are you yelling?
Resuscitation?
Flare up of old emotions...
He doesn't want my help.
How'd you get up here?
Yeah, let's go.
Don't worry about me, just go.
I can't believe you just said that.
Want me to lead?
Get it!
I'm holding you to that.  Gabe, what about Frank?
Ryan, get a rope, I want the man on a leash, too.
Half a day.
Then it's a deal.
We agree on something.  And for insurance, take his coat.
He can't be far away.  Find him. Go!
I told you, 50,000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals.
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
I don't give a shit, Qualen!  I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  They beat us.  A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
Doobidoob... a bit tired maybe, everybody is. A long night for growing malchicks... best not to say more. Bedways is rigthways now, so best we go homeways and get a bit of spatchka. Right, right.
Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well. To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit? Georgie rises.
Lets get things nice and sparkling clear. This sarcasm, if I may call it such, does not become you, O my brothers. As I am your droog and leader, I am entitled to know what goes on, eh? Now then, Dim, what does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend?
Phoned some friends, sir?
Julian. This will be these people now. Alex gets up.
Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him.
How do you do, sir?
Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.
Well, shall we get down to it?
Sorry, Em, I wanted it to be like... a big surprise for you and pee.
Well, yes, it's just a manner of speech from your Post Corrective Advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex. He puts his arm round Alex's shoulder.
As an unmuddied lake, sir. Clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, sir. Deltoid drinks again but this time sees the teeth in the glass. He groans and retches.
It's alright, thank you.
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
New way? What's this about a new way? There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me hear more.
What crime did you commit.
The accidental killing of a person, sir.
No, sir, I feel really great.
Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I've kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I've come to see you personally to see how you're getting along.
Well, who can blame them, sir?
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
No, brother. What d'you want?
... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
Through there for a bath.
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
But it was horrible.
Fine. Fine.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Just part of hospital routine.
Now then, each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture. You'll tell me what you think the person would say. Alright?
Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind.
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
Let me be sick... I want to get up. Get me something to be sick in... Stop the film... Please stop it... I can't stand it any more. Stop it please... please.
But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.
I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!
Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.
Indeed.
These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
Are you feeling better?
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
No.  I got lucky with the lights.
Travel...and things.
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
No, no, <u>wait</u>...
Where are you, what floor?
Yes!  Stay put, goddamn it!  Don't move from that spot...
You still carrying passengers?
This vehicle's not safe to drive. We're gonna have to impound it.  Get you towed.  Step away from the vehicle and pop the trunk.  I'm sorry, sir, you'll have to find another cab.
Oh, my, yes.
Unbelievable...  ...you hearing this?  Unbelievable.
It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
Very generous.
Take him down.  Save Richard Yip, our witness...
Ivan Petrov.  Supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up.  I come here, find this.
Elvis?
Pick me up in five minutes.
Detective Sergeant Phil Heller.
This isn't our goddamn game!
I got caught up at work.
Vincent.  It was nice to meet you. Visit again?
Hang on.  Carefully...
I see your point.
You should start a union.
You're cool.
It's a spasm!  Jesus, Max, don't be such a girl...
So?
You don't understand.  I mean it. Really.  I'm not up for this...
I can't believe this.
Lenny, my dispatcher.
Collateral damage.
I'm done.  Find another cab.
Sure?  Like you didn't play him? String him along?  If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go?
Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention.  That's bad.  And that's not good...
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
I don't get it.
I...I wasn't thinking.  I just did it.
You get benefits?
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
Who's Heller?
That's what you said...
...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision...
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry.  We're talking billions. Motive enough?
No.
Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
You're the boss.  Just don't make me repeat myself.  I hate that.
What?
Really?
You saved my life.
Yeah.  I think so.
This would be it?
Who?
Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too.
So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.
What?
I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?
Where were you the day he died?
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
He kept it in the side table in the front hallway.  He showed me.  I visited a few times.  Then one of Jonas's guys visited.  When I arrived, your dad was dying.
What about you?
You think it's a conspiracy?
Lysergic acid diethylamide... With a little kicker of my own.  Surely it must be coming back to you by now?
Then I can't be hurt anymore.
That's your option.  Ours could be to keep you locked up for a very long time.  In case you didn't know it, you're crazy.
And you have no idea where he lives?
Re-educating trained killers in the ways of polite society. Making sure the men who've gone over the edge won't hurt anyone. That sort of thing.
Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
Not today...
While we walk.  D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies.  No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
Yeah, I do.
No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
You can't just pull the plug, David.
It was a worthy experiment -- worthy of you; I was wrong about that part. But it's over now.
It'll just take a moment.
Maybe they are.  Maybe this is all part of the package.  The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.
In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
Could we hear God?
Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.
So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
You contacted us.  We were simply listening.  We've been listening for millions of years.
Childhood is over, Ellie.  It's time to grow up.
I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.
Not if you think like a Vegan.
That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
What are you talking about?  It's over.
The systems integration site.
Can't.  Doctor's orders.  The low oxygen/zero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive.  It's all right -- I like it here. Ever try sex in zero-G?
You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
That's what they all say.
How close are you to getting this funding put together?
Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more --
Ellie --
It's really happening.
That you, Valerian?
Like it or not.
What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
Prove it.
Maybe you're creating a monster.
Something like that.
And everybody you care about would be dead and buried.
You're willing to die for this.
Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
Pretty ironic, huh?  I had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy... Just to find you.
I'm not sure it's come to that.
I do.
Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
But --
Buck is a deal.
She took off with that convertible feller...
Yeah.
Oh lean over here, lady. Lean this way.
You don't know!
I know, I know. Just don't hit me.
Borrowin'.
Drag's been chain-ganging so long he's got a nose like a bloodhound.
It'd go to your coconut head. You'd start getting ideas. Maybe even pass right out.
I thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.
That's what you're gonna have to do.
We ain't goin' nowhere.
Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.
Bet! Babalugats, bet here!
Gettin' up, Carr.
Cuter again.
Kick a buck.
He's gonna lose a finger eating eggs like that.
Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
Andy?  When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'.  You look under the bad.  I'm three years old.  Call the prison.
When was the last time you washed your hair?
Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.
I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you want him.  The cute brutal type with handcuffs.  Very sexy.
You <u>slut</u>!  No sexy young cop for you unless you shampoo your hair.
Get out!  All of you!
Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
What day is this?  In jail you lose track.  This week.  Friday.
You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?
He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
We know...  Send the book to evidence...
What book?
Ah ha.  What did he want?
You know I can't do that.
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm in charge here.
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
Because I'm his damned pin-up girl! His, all of them!  They know me. They're in prisons with libraries, they collect clippings, I'm their worthy opponent.  You keep my name out of this.
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...
That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
Oh, shut up, and don't be so damn self righteous.
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
Not yet.
Listen to me.  Is there a gas station nearby?
They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it.
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
Just horseshit luck.
Classy madonna.
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
Yessir.
You got a suspect...
I just got here.  Talk to you later...
She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
I've been thinking about that, about you and Karen.
Thank you.
Yes. From Wendel. To celebrate, the license approval for our air-charter firm. I forgot to tell you.
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
Maybe I am a little.  James, I've got to leave for the office. Are you going to be all right?
No. But when he's in that car...
I'd better come with you, then. Are you sure you can drive?
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital.  I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
No.
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
You could get your wish at any moment.
Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
The case could be made.
What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
A crude sci-fi concept that floats on the surface and doesn't threaten anybody. I use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology.
Where are you?
I did this already.
I don't think you understand.    I won't wait.
Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh.  And, Michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. He's been in and out of...
I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.
I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
You're slowing.
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
Tomorrow?
Not even if it's something positive?
I understand you just got engaged. Maybe that's where we should start.
Sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my underwear.
Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.
No rounds for another three hours.
Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.
I wish I could have seen that.
My Grandma Rosa says that some trees get planted in rich top soil, and they grow right up to the sun, tall and straight. Other trees, they start as seeds in the crevices between rocks so they have to twist and bend to reach the light.  But even though they end up crooked, they're still trees, just like the straight ones.
Break up?    They wish.
Promise.  As long as we have steak.
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
Bingo.
How about a dance?
And all the plans we have.
She's only known the guy a few months.
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
Sure. Of course.
Are you all right?
Something you did?
I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how.
Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
Who?
Have you been seeing another teacher?
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
Sure, I understand.
That's so sweet, Michael. But, really, I've so many things to do.
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
It's Elvis...
Oui.
No.
Take what you've got and get out of there.
No thank you.
And?
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
But you were there?
I'm going to kill him myself!
And the Vodka.
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it.
Do I?
That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.
You better.
Why haven't you turned us in?
Boy, you must be pissed.
Great fuckin' song.
The Holiday Hotel.
Yes.
No.    145 Ridgeroad Way.
What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
It's my idea.

No! You can't have the baseball! You're not entitled to the fuckin' baseball!
No.
I said a clean break.
They sort of got away.
And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
Uh huh.
No thank you.
Although a cartoon I feel he shares a universal theme: We are all searching for love. No?
What?
-- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?
Take a nap.
The lucky ones.
I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.
Yes.
Why do you want to teach me?
That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
I'm just playing around.
Long.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
I'm bored.
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
About you and Li Mu Bai?
His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
Not another lecture!  On guard!
Only the sword will settle this.
What I've always wanted, to teach you.
Then you have no use for the sword.
Jen!
You're tired.  You need rest.  Your horse needs water.  There's a creek up here.
I don't take orders from anyone.
And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.
Fine.
Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
So what will you do now?
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
"We'll settle this at midnight on Yellow Hill."  Good, the fox is out of her hole.
Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
This is a delicate matter.
Annie, I need a file.
Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus change...
No.  I have one more thing to do.
You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it.
She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
I think he's yours, now.
You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.
I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.
Yes.
You work for the dead.  Forget that, and you can forget it all.
Leather purse...
This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real.
Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
I'm sure you're going to love it there.
I have his journal.
You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
What do you mean?
You did?
I must say I found it rather appalling.
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
Great book.
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
I said I was sorry.
You don't even know me.
I'm busy.
That's also none of your business.
And you promise to abide by it?
How was your date?
Wait, don't hang up.
What are you doing?
Reading.
You must take me for a real idiot.
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
Hi.
Yeah, me neither.
I know. I wish I felt the same. Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm completely fucked up.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?
Schwarz. Jewish?
- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
Don't think it's not going to cost you.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Don't you raise your voice at me. Go to your room, now.
It was nothing.
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
Okay.
What do you mean?!
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
Why didn't you do something?
Well... not exactly.
What do I do then?
I am?
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
It works a little.
Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
Would you please leave.
Jesus!
I'll be in touch.
I told you I don't know.
One.
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
Care to make a wager on that?
I'll think about it...
Oh sis. You're so tense.
Have you succeeded in your task?
Yippy.
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
Exactly the opposite.
So what went wrong?
I'm not in the mood.
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
Not that it's any of your business but yes.
Will you calm down?
I think you have your answer.
War it is.
It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
It's the least I can do.
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
It's really important.
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
But quite harmless, I'm sure.
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
Oh, you'll remember it some time.
Yes, darling.
Sometimes.
I made a wish today, and it came true just like Edward said it would.
The Farren house
I got my wish anyway.
But it's already come true.
Sh! Then you must keep it true. Goodnight, darling.
I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
Irena.
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
That's right.
Well, it seemed to me --
You're shouting at me.
I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
That darn kid. I never in my life expected her to get an A in arithmetic. Math's is a practical science --- if she understands figures, she's well out of her own world of make-believe.
She said something about that, Mrs. Reed — but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
I live right here.
Did you mail then?
But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
I did.  I came to an old dark house, and a voice called to me -- a lovely, sweet voice ---
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories — I'm sick of this sort of thing.
Why, daddy, you know my friend too!
She's there whenever I call her!
She's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there.
You called me by my name.
Whenever you want.
You can open it now, I guess. Lois Huggins says that's proper,
I shall wear it in my hair!
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong — warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
But she's dead!
Yes, Amy.
A lady threw it to me.
I wouldn't be surprised if it were a true wishing ring.
Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden.
Will you come soon?
One little piece of cake won't hurt you. Go ahead, take one. It's full of fruit...citron, cherries and ginger. It'll make you dream. Yes, wonderful dreams.
Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.
No.
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
I mean where on your body?
Oh, on my wrist.
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
So don't look in his eyes.
Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
Give him the tampon test.
I think he called you beautiful.
No! Not fucked him, I think I killed him.
I put it down the garbage disposal.
It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
I haven't gotten it yet.
I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.
What? Why'd you do that?
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
No.
Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
Well, whattdaya think?
Oh come on. Knock it off.
I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
No.
Come on Frida, I'm not kidding. I'm totally fucked. Let me in.
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
No.
No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
He's bad news. He cheated on me, he insults me. Now suddenly he gets jealous if I have a date.
Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets.
My period? No.
NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.
A man killed in Central Park.
Is that how you feel?
I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...
They do? Oh no...
No, it's a good thing. I like it. Everything about you is great. I like how you don't shave your legs. Women are so much sexier when they're natural.
What about... those guys... I might have...
Oh, I see... interesting theory.
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
No, I said it was our first date.
You got a dog?
Yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. It only works if you're on good terms.
You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
Hairy women are kind of sexy. Women in their natural state.
And you think I'm sick?
We only live a few blocks apart.
Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex.
One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed.
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
His wife.
Well, sir...  I don't know exactly.
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
I'm afraid so.
Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
Sheís getting better, thanks.  She...
Iíll be the judge of that.  Anything else?
That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
This ocean business...  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be?
Wait, this isn't fair...
Please...
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
Don't ask stupid questions.  Look at it.
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
... Alright.
No...
Yeah.
She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.
Clean.
You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
Are you out of your mind?
I was gonna do something with Joan.
Extend them.  C'mere for a second.
I know...  I know...  It's difficult for all of us.  But sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gQod of the country.
A teleprompter.
What?
Dave...
She knows.
So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
Yeah.
Oh... Kinda the same way.
Of course.
But it's ten-thirty at night.
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
You don't change, do you, Bill?
Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
Oh, come on, Bill.  Don't patronize me.   I'm not one of your little...  Turn around.  I'm talking to you!... Turnaround!
There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
You weren't in the state legislature.
Where are you going?
Home.
I'm starving.   There's got to be something open around here.
You have a lot of secrets.
Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.
Yeah, well... It's finally over.
... Me, too.
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
Come on.
Quiet!
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
It's...he was...one who came to the island with me.
The hospital? 
We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
A direct hit'll blow the top off this whole island! How're you gonna fuse the stuff? How're you gonna leave yourself time to get out?
I detest all my sins...because... because of Thy just punishment... because of Thy...just...punish...
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
Will do.
Don't come.
Well, no shit, Sherlock
Yeah!  Tell him off!  It couldn't get any worse.
Terrible.  Awful!  I met the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life!
It will?  How do you figure?
Women swoon!
The point is she was thinking about me! I've only met her once and already she's thinking about me.  Damn it, it's gonna happen!  I feel it.  She's going to be mine!
I'll tell you later.
He flatters me so I'll help him with Latin.
Except sex.
I told you, that's a secret.
Isn't he precious?
Miss it?  It drives us crazy.  That's part of what this club is about.  In fact, I'd like to announce that I've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets society, demanding girls be admitted to Welton, so we can all stop beating off.
What?
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
All right!  I'm thinking!  "Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments; love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove."
Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't quite flunk English so if you want, we've got our study group.
All right.  I'll second that.
No.
Damn it, Neil, the name is Nuwanda.
What good will that do?
You are?  She's glad I called!
All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."
Knox, you are so infuriating!
Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
What is that?
My Word
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
Carpe Diem... seize the day.
Meeks.
Rahesh Non never existed, Mr. Meeks. You make him or someone like him up.  No self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one I received:
I didn't know you taught.
YAWP!
LOUDER!
A madman.
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
Excellent!  Have him act.  Give it rhythm!
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
It's not too bad.  It's a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry.  Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.
When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.
Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
Father, I have the main part.  The performance is tomorrow night.  Father, please.
Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
That's miles.
The god of the cave.
Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
Nothing.
I... I just don't want to come.
Yes.  But
And now he will?
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
I will be with thee straight.
Do you have to quit the play?
I don't know.
Yes.
We have to make it to the third deck...
Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
Dead.
Then who are you?
I'm their ride.
Jesus Christ lady...
What are those things?
No...
Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
I saw these guy perform...at Altmont ...you know that? They opened for the Stones...
That way.
Joey...
Like Mamooli's country...
I'm looking...
Shut up!
John...
What happened to Vivo?! What the hell happened to Vivo?
You want 'em?
Who's going?
I'll get it! Where is it?
Well... you remember Cynthia?
She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!
Couple of weeks... Listen --
Tell him, Vince.
No.
No, I --
Ah yes. Of course.  To the girl who waits.
No. None of that.
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
Everybody love Linda.
No.
Too bad.
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Yeah?
Shhh! Albert's gonna hump the Coup de Ville.
Oh well! What do you mean Oh well?! The guy is actually... He did it again! That's what he's doing... He... He's reaching in, John, to her --! I'll kill him! I'm gonna kill him right now.
Vince!!!
Psst. Vince!
Inside, Vince.
Sit down. Here. Right here.  Albert! Vince!
No?
Sure.
I don't know.
No.
Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee.
C'mon. I've got the car.
I... No. You do this for money?
Ah yes. Of course... So few survive.  La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release?
Who the hell knows!
You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this.
Fucking A.
Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do.
You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
From Nam?
Merle --
You got it.
Huh?
What do you mean, no???
You know what I think? There's times I think you're a goddamn faggot!... I fixed you up a million times, Merle!  I fixed him up a million times! I don't know how many times I fixed him up... and nothin' ever happens... Zilch! Zero!... The trouble with you, Merle, no one knows what you're talking about! "This is this"? What does that mean, "this is this"? I mean is that some faggot bullshit, or is that some faggot bullshit!!! And if it isn't, what the hell is it???
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can hardly --
Merle? ... Merle's alive?  How do you know?
Didn't I ever tell you about Phantom Mary?
What's it for??
One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.
In the timeless words of Squire Albert...
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
Up ribbon!
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
I'll be alright.
Remember my promise.
He could be brought back.
I've also drafted a letter to families of officers killed in the line of duty.  They'll need your signature.
How do I look?
Go in the house.
Are you a cop?
Whoa.  Don't touch that.  <u>Pursuit</u> <u>Mode</u>.  Auto pilot.  Computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits.  Installed Fall 2006.  Underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir.
Some things never change.
Pass.
Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
How then?
I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
Then find me some cigarettes.
<u>Comwatch Dispatch System</u>.  Can't assimilate voice stress.  Code priority only.
...What are you talking about...?
Well I've got news for you.  This dirty cop was the <u>only cop</u> who could bag Doucet.
My mom says I'm gonna grow.
Oh --  Didn't mean to talk like that in front of a lady.  Get some wine for the Squire, Belle.
No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire?
It does hurt! And don't you do it again.
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
I did not, Grandma.
Howdy, Hank.
No, Stone!
You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air.  Like that!
Afraid ... of what?
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
Stevens -- what's all this leading up to? You know something. Come on! Out with it -- you know something about me!
You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
The seventh day of April --
Look here now--
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
What -- what's on your mind?
No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?  Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
You want me to go around --
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
Mary -- look! Hessian gold. I found it in the barn.
I'd love to.
There is nothing to worry about now.
Don't take cold, Jabez.  Come -- it's warm in here.
Thanks, Mary.
I'm serious.
And I don't want to have a washwoman for a wife.
Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
Oh, for heaven's sake, leave me alone!
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
I can't help it. I mean it, I tell you. I've had more than my share. Nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing!
Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
Make out? We'll do better than that!  I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am. I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain!
Let him try it.
Very well, folks. I accept.
Coming, Ma.
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
You aren't angry with me?
-- I'm going to try, Mr. Webster.
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
I'll drink to that, Mr. Scratch!
Married.
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
So, you divorced of what?
Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.
No, sir.
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
The police...?
John?  Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing?
His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance...
That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
What does he want?
Okay.
I'm going to count to three...
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
* Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.
Gennero.  Miss Gennero.
Uh, what do I call you?
Then this won't matter.  LAPD's not calling the shots anymore.
Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
-- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close.
You know, Sonny, I used to dope a lot, and I was into dipping?  And I did a couple bank jobs, and the Lord Jesus in his everlasting mercy saved me, you know how?
No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head...
But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it.
He ain't going out.  And if I go out he's just gonna kill the people. There's a lot of lives that I'm responsible for... that's all.  So, I can't do anything.  I got myself into this mess and I'll get myself out of it... the best way I know how!  One of the ways is not giving up.  I'm telling ya!
These guys that got me down here, you know, huh... they think that I'm part of this whole thing.  They think I'm part of the plot to rob the bank!
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
Yeah.
Yeah... I'll write a song.  Ha, ha. I don't know.  Life is funny!
He won't listen to anybody.  He's been very crazy all summer.  Since June he's been trying to kill me.
You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
Call me Sonny-boy.
Call me whatever you want.
Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
Well, armed, then.  Nobody's been hurt.  Release the hostages, nobody is gonna worry over kidnapping charges, the worst you're gonna get is five years -- you can be out in a year.
Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
Is on its way ... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to Kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
All right ... I got some hungry people in there ... I want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...
He's totally unstable.  He'll make a mistake.
Come on, lemme load you up...
Gimme the traveler's checks and the register.
Gimme the keys to get outta here!
You're goin' outside with me.  If there's no cops around, we just split.  Otherwise, you go with us.
If you take anybody, please take me.
I'm not going.  I'm okay.
Oh, Jesus!  You want to be a martyr or a hero or what?
You know - I had a job once.  I used to work in a bank.  I had been training ... I used to have a boss ... Mr. Don Frio ... he wore a toupee ... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job ...
I'm glad it's okay.
Howard!
When was the last time you saw Sal?
Fuck him - let him out!
But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
We're not there yet.
Yeah ...
He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal.  What's wrong with him?
I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.
I want them all.
Gimme the black guy...
You follow my car. 
I speak what I feel.
It's not a joke.  I got this terrible fear of being locked in...
Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.
What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?
I don't know ... It's where they got the money.  I mean, if you want to steal, you go to where they got the money, right?
Get a job doing what?  You gotta be a member of a union, no union card - no job.  To join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card.
Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?
<i>Choco grew up on the streets of El Salvador. When he was four years old... he stabbed another kid in the eye-ball with a pencil.</i>  <i>There were wires crossed somewhere in his soul.</i>
For the love of God. Not Spanish again. Who's the girl?
<i>He killed two children.</i>
<i>We gotta bring him in.</i>
<i>I'm gonna kill you, Ed.</i>
<i>Chinga te y tu mama tambien.</i>
Yes.
What?
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
Mr. Weiss was very generous in turning over some video tapes to the FBI. There's lots of footage of you. We know everything.  If you don't come clean... the information on these tapes could send you to prison for a very long time.
That's the rumor on the street.
<i>Her car was in the shop.</i>
You have sixty seconds... here's the question...  Which one of you is Frances?
Son, with the exception of Spring Break in Tijuana, have you ever ventured outside of California?
Exactly. Why don't you leave the guns behind this time? Go in with only batons, brass knuckles, and numb-chucks.
Real good.
He makes all his money off us Black people and I don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers.  Ya see what I'm saying, homeboy?
Excuse me.  I'm very sorry.
I own a brownstone on this block.
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
You come in here at least three times a day.  You a retard?  A buck fifty.
Two dollars!  Forget it!
Boycott Sal's.  Boycott Sal's.
No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
I'm cool.  I'm cool.
No, you the man.
No.  I'm just a struggling Black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world.
We're not hanging out.  I'm being escorted back to work.
OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break it down.
I'm not stopping.  I'm on my way.
You're welcome.
Gotta go.
Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me?
Fifty cents.
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
Good!  Leave me alone when I'm sleeping.  I'm gonna get a lock on my door, to keep ya ass outta here.
Later.  Gotta get paid.
I didn't stutter.  Take care of your responsibilities.  Y'know exactly what I'm talking about.
I'm getting paid...
Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is an old woman.
Twenty "C" Duracells.
D, not C.
That's right on time.  This is my friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.
ML, hold this for me.
Tonight, when we close.
You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
C'mon, Sal.
My salary.  Two-fifty.
No.  What are you gonna do?
I can dig it.  It's gonna be HOT as a motherfucker.
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
Where's the ice cream?  The Häagen- Dazs butter pecan?
Trust me.
Ya like him, huh?
Sez me.
I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
And that's exactly what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.
Then we could try something else.
Pop, what else can I say?  I don't wanna be here, they don't want us here.  We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst.
'Bout time, Pop.
I'll tell you why!
A field trip? Maybe I'll join you. See you tomorrow.
Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?
Gotcha.
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
Well la de da.
LLOYD, did you ask your parents?
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
I go to school where I live.
Me too!
Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.
Yeah, he's a pirate.
She did not.
Where did you learn that word?
Okay. Anyone else have any questions?
I'm kidding! Of course I'll be your partner.
Shut up!
You have beautiful eyes.
JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.
What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be "it".
You thinking what I'm thinking?
I don't know who we are anymore.
Roger that, Wilco.
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
Okay. Which one do you want?
You mean the lunch room?
I wouldn't know. Being that I'm just the teacher and all.
So could you get us into the principal's office?
Oh, go on.
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
Can you believe it?
What are you talking about?
Of course it does.  Obviously in denial.  Maybe we can help.
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
I liked it a lot.
Hey can be on top?
We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
Small potatoes. This one is big time. This is visionary. This idea is genius.
Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!
And you are great in bed.
It's a surprise.
Are you going to kill her?
Oh yes? -- NAVIGATOR Better than those on Richesse.. You are transparent... I see many things... I see plans within plans.
I'm sorry Gurney.
Oh great mother!  He's trying the voice. The Reverend Mother said it could save him.
Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.
You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning.  In time you perverted the truth.  You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan.  How little you understand.
I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
Always?
What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it!
What is it?
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
Did they try and fail?
They tried and died.
I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
Don't you bave a car?
No more.  I haven't worked in four years.  This town, it chews you up, then spits you out.  I'm just an ex-bogeyman.  Make a right.
Ah, so I pull the strings!
Eh, forget it.  What else is big?  Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
So why didn't you do it?
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
Formaldehyde.
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
Soon, Bela... Soon.
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
I know none of <u>my</u> wives would've.
No problem.  I know it by heart...
I don't know.  Where?
Rolling.
Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
The ghost can be barefoot.  <u>Give</u> <u>me your shoes</u>!
Ed, it was only one review.
No!  A horror movie star!
So did you get his autograph?
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
Oh!  You got nerve, buddy.
Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene.
I understand you just moved here?
He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
Wood?  Ward?  Wood.  Hey, what do you know.  It <u>is</u> Wood. Dang secretaries, you can never get a good one.  Right?
That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
Yes?
Oh, of course!
Nah, that doesn't matter!  It's a visual medium.
Hopefully, very soon.  I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM.
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
Fine, maybe you're right.  But it doesn't friggin' matter.  I can't afford a star, so I don't even know what we're talking about.
There's still a sex-change --
Um, I guess --
Why not??
Maybe it needs special handling.
You look beat.
Not good...
I like to wear women's clothes: Panties, brassieres, sweaters, pumps... it's just something I do. And I can't believe I'm telling you, but I really like you, and I don't want it getting in the way down the road.
Okay?
Thanks.  It's actually the only thing I know how to make.  Hey, can you grab that strainer?
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
Yeah...  I should give her a call.
So?  It's only a five-hour drive. And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert.  Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner.  I promise.
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
You don't wanna be noticed?
What octopus motor?
Are you IN5ANE?  <u>I'm</u> the director! <u>I</u> make the casting decisions around here!
I suppose.  It's very expensive.
You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth.  Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
No. Only celebrities now. Now, if you put a mailman on the cover of a magazine he'd better have killed someone or no one will buy it. This one to Dr. Rumpley.
Went --
Oh, Al ... This is just...
This is real, Bananahead!
Excuse me.
Uh-huh?
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
Ed --
Who?
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
When? Today?
No! And that girl has a name.
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
She could've been a nurse.
I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.
It was horrible. He called me up.
Who?
Oh my god! On TV!
She left.
Never would be plenty.
Dynamite.
I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.
So?
Somewhere.
Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
Okay.
The what?
What?
My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.
It's nice.
I know. I mean I'm sitting there and her father's asking me about my "career prospects" and I'm playing "Risk," with her kid brother, Leon and at dinner the dog's sniffing at my balls -- at least I hope it was the dog. 'Cause her mother disappeared for a while.
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
Screw off.
Marcia's living with a singer?
Ray --
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
You brought the cameras here!
I love you! 1 want to marry you!
No. Am I supposed to?
It's Ed.
The whole time? Eighteen years?
Mm.
What happened? You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
El/ella -
Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a cute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You know you're a sweet little love maker...
What kind of person?
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
Looks like Tim Kobza.
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Nooo.  I just thought...  l mean, I am looking for a new car.  But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends.  And then things would be different.  Don't you think?
You'll be fine.
Yeah... whatever.  All I know is she's a troublemaker.  She's on my list.
Thanks. Well. I'm going home now.
Okay.  But is this about the posters?
Exactly when?
And how did you get in the school?
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
I have proof.
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Me?  I took advantage of you?  You hugged me!  You kissed me!  You're the one who --
Yeah.
And she's super-nice
Exactly.  So what do you say?  Maybe it's time to give a little something back.
Oh, okay.  Yeah, sorry.
No way I It doesn't make sense.
If you say so.
Larry, you just take it easy
What?
Thought what?
Thanks.  You too.  It was great working with you.
You know how they say one day a big meteor might come and crash into the Earth and kill everybody? Well, I think that would be a good thing.
Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.
How'd you like to make it 1960?  I know the judge and Sergeant Exley here is friends with hte D.A.
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
How'd she meet Patchett?
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
So tell me about it.
No.  Now.  You fucked him.
Call me Dudley.
Homicide?  A detective?
Of course... But how?
How'd you get them to retract?
Seen him around.  He used to be a cop.
What was that boyfriend's name?
Look at a picture for me.
Somebody got wind of it, killed them all.
Let's just kill them.
What?
With a wrecking ball.  You want to help me swing it?
Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this.
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
That's right.
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
What do you want to know?
Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
Where do they get their stuff? Come on.  Give me one to feed the D.A.  Just a little one.
They shot him in his library.
But you were business associates?
He runs call girls.  Primo tail. Fixed up like movie stars.
Dudley, we've been over this.
I... No.
No.
She may still be alive, whoever she is.
Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
That's right.
Give me a minute, will ya?
I want you to follow Bud White.
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
You make a mistake?
Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
Great.  You get the girl, I get the coroner.
I get the idea.  You got a description?
Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
How about White?
Because you'll use it against me. Won't you?
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
I'm not going to dignify youwith answers.  If you'll excuse me, I've got a Jack Vincennes press conference to prepare for.
I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
Sid, it's Vincennes.
Jackie, are you back on Narco?  I need copy.
You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
I put Reynolds in the cab myself. The night cost me a hundred scoots and I got bupkis.
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
Maybe you should have thought of that before you made Bloody Christmas page one.
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
Nothing. Two nights later I was robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros.
You're not.
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
Clear as day.
When can you get it here?
I'll come straight there.
I don't know who he is.
Who was that other guy?
One of many people who would live a word with you.
You're crazy.
Why are they after <u>me</u>?
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
Wait. What do I do?
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
We said a hundred.
One-twenty.
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
They shouldn't have come without calling first.
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
It'd never get through. All packages are screened, x-rayed and then hand-searched for explosives. You didn't like my "give-me-my- money" idea?
Not particularly, no.
Who's calling?
What are you saying?
Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
Hello. Hello, Maria.
Okay.
For that matter, I think you will too.
I didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.
Thanks.  Who are you?
Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident.
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
Than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
Not that I could see.
I thought maybe it might be for Rachel Banks.
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
Right.
You should take this seriously.
In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
He's got his priorities?
"Sources revealed an FBI investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars--
I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
I know.
It's not real...  That's not me.
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
Stacy--
I know, but listen--
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
I'm sorry about Rachel.
It's a brand new card.
Brill.
Someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a--
You're not.
How can I be sure.
I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
Eat your fish.
All right, look--
Will you hang on just a second.
Bullshit.
This conversation's over.
We believe he did.
Otherwise you may have to what?
--otherwise we may have to--
Otherwise you may have to what?
I don't under--
Because she's reading the newspaper, you asshole.
Can I open 'em up?
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
No.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
What about jewelry?
The blender?
An investigation? It was a bus accident.
Christ!
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed--
Yes.
Jesus.
I don't know!
Jerry--
Bobby, you're in way over your head.
I don't know.
Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.
It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--
Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir?
Contact COINTEL. Profile. Assess the threat. Then cross-check against Zavitz. Red-flag the intersects and anything we can exploit. Also NRO. Pull up the keyhole tapes. I need to own him. I need to own him <u>now</u>.
Get it.
Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god<u>dammit</u>, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!
For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.
He's carrying the damn <u>flag</u>.
No.
I don't want to go back.
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
Look over there.
No.
Yes.  Absolutely.
Will you please come in?
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
No.
I'm trying to write with your taste in my mouth.  Swoon.  I'll catch you.
It's a long song - Szerelem means love…and the story - there's a Hungarian Count, he's a wanderer, a fool.  For years he's on some kind of quest, who knows what? And then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman - a harpy - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave.  He sews her clothes, he worships the hem of -
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
Shall we be all right?
No.
Dance with me.  I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
It hurts too much.
Oh dear.
Our Garden, our garden - not so much the garden, but the copse alongside it, wild, a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and France.  The Devil's Chimney it was called -  The Devil's Chimney, I don't know why.  Darling.  My darling.
Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility…
I told you so.
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
You are a Canadian spy working for the Allies.  Code-name Moose.
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
For?
Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft…
Apprentices.
To arm-twisting.
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
Do I recognize him?  I recognize what he is. I like him.  He's Canadian.  He can read Italian.  He can catch rabbits.
Really?  That's sudden.
Hey! -
I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
Kip… I -
I'll always go back to that church.
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
Does he have to go?
I thought that was for when we were very very old?
I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent.  Hana follows him.
I don't think so.
No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almásy, who doesn't look up from his book.
- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
Then you were married?
Through a window.
I'd need an introduction. From someone he trusts. Someone who owes us a favor.
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
Then don't.
Meet me in front. Five minutes.
Are you...okay?
Not interested.
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
It's only on exhibit at the Queen's Museum this month. Even if you could get into the museum, the Mask bas its own security system. A special, randomly programmed interval code.
That's my girl.
Not funny.
I'm not the one to ask...
Good morning.
You need a partner for this job. You'll never find one as good as me.
You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
It's not a village. There's nothing there.
My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me.
Popup, on floorboards. And--
You can't be too careful.
What do I need a thief for? I've got the Mask.
The big job.
There is no big job.
A billion dollars.
Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
My job, my rules.
Charged.
There is one more thing.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
A flaw in your research, my dear. I grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast.
I'm leaving from the Nathan Road Station at 6:30 tomorrow morning. You could come too.
We can't help it, we...we've gotta...
What about you?
You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
Sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable.
This better be worth 1t.
I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
You change partners, you change the rules.
Probably not.
You're kidding, right?  Look at these readings for Christ's sake. PG&E's own technicians documented toxic levels of hexavalent chromium in those test wells, on numerous occasions.
250,000 is all I'm authorized to offer.
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
I thought the same thing, right off the bat. That's why we went to see the doctor.  But hunh-uh.  Turns out one's got nothing to do with the other.
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
For what?
Five million dollars.
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.
Excuse me?
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just assumed you were off having fun.
Boy, are you ever a shitty judge of people.
They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
Lemme see it, will you?
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
That wasn't an offer.  A million would've been an offer.  When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you.
Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole fucking family.  Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if, you find me the evidence to back all this up -- I'll do it.  I'll take it on.
<u>No</u>.
Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here --  Do you mind?
Yeah, I mind.  You bet your ass I mind.
Is that what you want?
Gee, I wonder why.
Erin, it's just a meeting.
So why would PG&E offer it?
The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
Did he say why?
Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin.
I guess I did.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Thank God we got you away from her, huh?
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
Now, don't be like that.  Tell you what. How about if I take you out on a date to apologize for my rudeness?
I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.
What do you mean?
I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  I got fired.
You're someone to me.  You're someone real special to me.
How would you know?
Nothing.
Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
Just a few more minutes, then we can go.  Take her, will you?
Bull<u>shit</u>, Erin.  Bullshit.
Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
What?
My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.
I know.  But it's good for me.  Now I can help my daughter take care of my grandkids. And it's good for you, too.  Now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh? Not the old lady next door.
He did, didn't he?  <u>Baxter</u>!
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
But you cannot control it.  This is a dangerous time for you, Luke. You are now most susceptible to the temptations of the dark side.
Barks his Òright on!Ó
Barks his agreement.
I'm looking for a great warrior.
Because of my father, I guess.
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
We are fighting for a cause much ...
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
That's quite a compliment.
Why?
It's not my fault.  I can't under- stand it!
The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
Let Ôer go, Chewie.
Me either.  They had me howling on the scan grid, but they never asked me any questions.
I'll have my people get to work on it right away.  Hate the thought of the Millennium Falcon without her heart.
I'm sorry too.
This ought to be good.
Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.
I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
I didn't say anything?
I'll be back later.
If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...
First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
Jabba the Hutt?
I've never seen it fail.
I thought I was in good shape.
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
That they are.
That would matter not were The Force flowing through you.  Higher you'd jump!  Faster you'd move! Open yourself to The Force you must.
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
They suggested oranges.
I did not call her mad.  I merely asked her if she was.  And I repeat the question.  Are you mad?
With food?
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
Keep him in cold storage till the reports in.  Then send him to Taxidermy.  He's a museum piece.
I should.  I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.
Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
I got a new deal for you.
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
Dream on, blue eye.
We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
That's the deal.
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
A medical team will be standing by.
Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the button.
Cease fire with the bullshit.
I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.
No screamin' shit.
I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
No! Stay away, Snake. He's mucho muerte.
You're running out of time.
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
I will not. You must retreat or prove your kingship in the test of arms, under the eyes of God.
--It is the old wound, that has been opened. I have always known it would be the gateway to my death, for it has never healed. Let my heart do its job, my King, and pump me empty...
Of Merlin?
I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there.
'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.
The dragon! There...
What's this, what's this?!
Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
You betray the boy who drew the sword, the boy who saw the Dragon... the Dragon who moves close by, coiling and uncoiling, restless, looking down, waiting for the King to be a king...
Well hurry then, and get it.
No. I meant not to be angry with you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil. You merely repeat it. Please, sir, have one of those apples that Lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness.
Not you, my husband?
And you cannot love me...
No.
There is one.
Love demands it.
We are to blame.
Maybe... maybe...
People make you laugh?
Doing what I did for you, it wasn't easy, you know. It takes it's toll. It took nine moons to get back my strength.
Hiding?
I didn't know that.
In here!
Groceries maybe? A package?
Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
All right then we've got clean rats.
A man to see you.
No thanks Karl.
Yes, I think so.
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
The best explanation is always the simplest one. Let's wait. Let's wait and see. In the meantime try not to worry.
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
Please go away.
Didn't tell you of what she did?
Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the meantime...
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
Holy water's blessed. And that doesn't help support a case for possession.
Think it was a guilding. It was grey. Oh it was so beautiful, the guy let me ride it all around.
You like it?
Where?
No you don't. I do it all the time.
Oh yeah, well let's both play.
Captain who?
Who's Captain Howdy?
He's nice.
I don't know
Your not gonna marry him are you?
I don't know, I just thought.
Okay.
Why does God let us get tired?
My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.
So something please Doctor, Help her!
That's his office back of St. Mike's. He's our psychiatric counsellor. He had a pretty rough knock last night poor guy, his mother passed away. She was living by herself and I guess she was dead a couple of days before they found her.
I stole it.
Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
You just missed them.
Who's in it?
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
You and Regan?
Quod nomen mihi est?
No.
Now momma you have to stay off it, you can't keep go up and down those stairs you have to give it rest.
Okay
I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, there seems to be three. She's convinced-
In the face of the enemy.
Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for all consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion.
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
I don't know anyone who fits the description.
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Why not?
I'm afraid.
What about tomorrow?
It's all there.  Both nights.
Twelve years.
It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables. It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you. I love both you guys, you know that. You're class.  But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Honey ...
Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
No.
Get your hand off me.
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
My pleasure.
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Huh?
Fuck him.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
Thanks.
Why the interest?
I don't gotta go.
Says who?
Something came up.  Don't worry, Charlie stayed true.  Both nights. I'll give you your share tomorrow. At the house.
Yeah, okay.
Honey, it's only Uncle Jack.  You remember Uncle Jack.
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
What?
I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
Here, how's this?
Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
Right.
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
Doesn't it matter to you?
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
They stopped serving two hours ago.
What the hell are these?
We were just having a little discussion about morality.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
Better give her pneumonia.
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
Oh, yeah, right.  I forgot.
This'll kill 'em.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
Yeah?
She asked for it.
Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
Really?  Isn't that a coincidence.
Punctuality.  First rule of show business.
Miss --
You find a girl?
Don't leave a girl hanging. Second rule of show business.
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
We're a team.  We work together.
Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
Big feet.
Zip me up?
Oh, thanks.
You're a prince.
Hey!
We take the Avedon, right?  Simple.
First times. Hey, look at this.
Got another song for us?
Well then ... shall we?
Uh ...
And two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night.  Frank, I can't sing that fucking song anymore!
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
I'll call you.
So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here.  What d'ya say?
Right.  Bring him back.
Come on, Ed.
Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.
For a while.  She left.
He'll come around.
His kid's sick.
Can't sleep?
Like a baby. You?
Nothing.
All I said was you were good.
You were good.
Who's Nina?
Friend.
Soap?
No kidding?
You're kidding.
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
Oh.
Frank wasn't 'there.
Yeah.  Got my own sign.
You don't pick your brother.
So how's the cat food business?
I've given it up.
If I see him.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
Is that what you used to do?
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?
He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.
Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
Of course he is ...  -- He's yours too.
They haven't found it yet -- Listen, Pollux ...
Shut up.
So?  The procnias averano is a South American bird.  The flight here was only three hours!  And yesterday a European swallow flew by! Where the fuck are we?
I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
For what?
"Thanks?"  I guess they really did fuck you up.
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
How come?
Jon, what is it?
He'd see that a mile away.  The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is his brother.  Unfortunately, turnips can't talk.
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
Or what?  You'll have me fired?
Like you know anything about it.
Business first.  I went into the "Warrants" system and erased your records.  You're clean.  In fact, you're now on the informant payroll.
You've made us look pretty good in the past week.  And the way you handled the press --
No.  Most of them are in transit by now.  I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
That's what I'd like to know.  She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.
You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
Adelle?
Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?
I’m not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
You’re jumping, sweetheart...
That’s right.  Okay, let’s make a quick stop at the kids’ shoe department, pick up my watch from the battery place, then I’ll run into the linen store...
On a case by case basis...
Try not to be late because kids don’t like to be the last one picked up.
One year he had a solar system named after her...
I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
It’s just two kids, right?
So could you write down her exact address?
I’m telling you, those rules don’t apply to me, Arn.
Screw the rules.  I’m talking about the choice.
I never won anything in bowling.
Look, I'm talking about a business deal here.  I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter...  ...doesn't have a death wish  ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars.
I've got everything I need.
Wow.  It must be great being you.  You got it all.
I don’t think so, thank you...
Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Need a nurse?
What are you talking about?  It’s me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
About the plane? What do you think it’s gonna crash? Don’t say that...
You mean don’t go at all? What about my internship?
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
We're being responsible.  Go. Get on the plane.
Yeah...fine.
Telling my mother she doesn’t have to stay with the kids.
You’re having a bad day, I’ll go with you...actually, there’s no way in hell you’re gettin’ me back out there...
I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, there’s no question about that.  But this...  ...you’ve really grown into a beautiful woman...
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
Surprise.  We’re pregnant...  Yeah...that must’ve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
Sure.  I really like Annie.
Good, Jack.  Maybe we’ll keep her.
You had a heart attack?
Oh yeah, you’re a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...I’m gonna take you to that special place...
How do you even know about this place?
Are you sure?
C’mon, Jack, you think there aren’t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I’m doing in New Jersey...
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
Think bigger.
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
Then get a goddamn snow blower!
That’s the one...
Aspen.
Do I know you?
But you’re not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
You won’t regret it...  Tommy!  Set Mr. Conlin up with four B.F. Goodrich G-Force T/A’s...  ...and give him ten percent off for having the best costume...
Is there anything I can do for you?
Of course I did.
I'd like that, too.
Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
I've got plenty of places to go.
Merry Christmas...
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
I wouldn't know anything about that.
No, I mean...I'm a little...dusty...
Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
Ben.  Are you okay?
If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
O-kay.  We'll skip that question.
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
I don't care about rocks, I care about <u>you</u>.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
I'm worried about you.
Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company.
And they're changing into...
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Ben, are you there?
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Not this again --
<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
That's the temperature of the <u>sun</u>.
But Johnny...you <u>can't fly</u>.
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
What?  What do you mean you --
Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into the city grid...
That would have kinda defeated the purpose.  And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
You <u>need</u> a doctor.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
You can't leave them out there.
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love.  To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
Medical's ready.
Normally not. Unless it's an Arterio-Venous Fistula --
The less time, the better.
Along the Optic Nerve to the Eye.
How bad off is he?
You mean <I'm> going along?
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
But big enough for us...
Dr. Michaels is right. We have no choice.
You can't --it's too dangerous --
A surgeon might...
You're not the first, but he's much too innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what's going on around him.
Maybe we can...  Skipper, is there a snorkel on this sub?
Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
"Proclaiming in incandescent glory The myriad Mind of Man..."
Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --
We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.
Go ahead.
Positions, please. And strap yourselves in.
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
Where's my daughter?
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
Yeah, yeah, Jesus - I'm sayin', we'll stop for pancakes, then we'll get laid. Wuddya think?
Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
So why don't you just ask him for the money?
Personal matters.
That's right. And we need more money.
Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -
You're there in thirty minutes or I find you, Jerry, and I shoot you, and I shoot your fucking wife, and I shoot all your little fucking children, and I shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. Got it?
GOT IT?
Okay, real good, then.
You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles! You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already!
Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -
Can you be any more specific?
Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
Oh, man!
What's the next step here, Jerry?
It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any.  These men, they just want money, see.
Yeah, but -
Huh? Yah?
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
Yah, but -
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
Know who this is?
Well, what do ya mean?
Yah, no, I'm sure you are. Shep vouched for you and all. I got every confidence in you fellas.
Yah.
Yah, okay.
No kiddin'?
Yah.
Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional!
Yah?
No, no, I just wanna get Norm some night crawlers.
So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.
Yah - easy there - you do too!  I'm expecting, ya know.
Yah, sorry, so I was married to Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda?  She was a year behind us.
Uh-huh.
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
What'd he say?
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
Yah?
Prowler needs a jump.
Oh, fine.
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
Yah. Well, I just can't thank you enough, Detective Sibert, this cooperation has been outstanding.
Oh.
And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
No, I wasn't aware...
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
Well, if any ideas come to you, give me a call.  In the meantime, don't leave town.  I may need to bring you in for questioning.
Can't you give me something?
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
What?
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
A year?  How'd you manage that?
Please.  Can't we do something... ?
Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much.
Do you want to wait to hear me describe death?
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
Whatever.
He's not here.
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
What did you say... ?
You have to get out of here.  Leave as soon as possible.  Go to any rural town, away from any major city...
You were in here last Thursday night.
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
You're a tourist.  I saw you at melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular cancer.
... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
I mean -- for a living.
What?
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
What's that?
A nice, big cock.
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off?
What?
Alive or dead?
Hemingway.  You?
Good answer.
"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
I thought you did.
What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
Look...
I'm not asking you to.
What?
"Training?"  Tyler...
The house is rented in your name.
You have jobs.
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
You want out?
What?
i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
Not exactly according to plan.
I'm doing this for us.
What?
You told me you'd say that, too.
Well, sir, you said you might.
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
Too much school.
Exact order?  Then I'm next!  I was meant to die with my friends, so I'm next!
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
No, it's not here.  This one was different.  More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.
He probably already knows we're coming.
What, you think Death planned for each of us to die in the pile up weeks ago?  You're nuts.
Blow me.
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.
What?
Jorge.  When I get out of here I'm going to sue his cheating ass off.
Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.
I never mad it.  The Greyhound bus I was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop.
Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
The log truck...and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did.
Then you believe all this??  That Death is working off a list?
Clean up?  I don't...
No time.  Keep going.  I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
Hey, don't be knockin' the Chevette.
When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
Let us out!
It doesn't matter who's next... we're all on the same list.
Been on many planes that blew up, have you?
Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
No.
Yeah.  It's not hard once you get the hang of it.  In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one...
We're leaving tonight, not in a week.
Home on my strobe.
Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
Nothing we can do, man.
What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
I suppose you have...
Why's that?
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
Where?
Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
Have fun.
I say we tape him to a chair.
Do I look like I have someone special?
Meeting ... people.
I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
I don't understand you. What is the problem?
That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
Hey? What did I tell you? Why don't you come? It's just dinner. You'll have something to tell your mother next time she calls.
I was attacked.
You still believe in God?
Oh sure... Gotta believe in God.  But I don't think God made man in his own image.  No.  'Cause most of... the bullshit that happens, is because of men.  No, I think man was made out of the devil's image and women were created out of God -- because women can have babies which is sorta like creating, and which also explains why women are attracted to men, because, lets face it, the devil is a helluva lot more interesting -- I slept with a few saints and let me tell you... <u>Booooorring</u>!!!... And so the whole point of life, I think, is for men and women to get married so the devil and God can live together and, ya know -- work it out...  ... Not that we have to get married.
I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.
You're kidding!  What did he say?
<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.
Good.  You believe this drunk?
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
Fine.  I'll say no.
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
Well..um...you get an official membership card...  Just sign that and we'll laminate it right here... Parry?  You want to laminate Miss Sinclair's card?...
Lydia.  Lydia what?
No... thanks... Listen --
Where -- ?
A quest?
They work for Him.
You really want to help me?
All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
WILL YOU PLEASE... please listen to me ...  You know none of this is true -                           PARRY the Grail, the voices...                           Jack... There's a part of you that                         Come on...what are knows this isn't true.                             saying... I know who you are...                              I know who you are.. or who you were.                                   You're acting really- You don't belong on the                            No, no, no, no... streets. You're intelligent                        Jack... man....you're a teacher...                         Jacck!... You were a teach at Hunter College. Don't you remember?...                               
I don't like horror movies!
Why does it sound exciting? There's absolutely nothing exciting about it.
Listen, you're very nice... b...
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.
Shhh...
I hope that's all you gotta say, El, 'cause I'm about as tired of your mouth as I am workin' this stinkin' hole!
You said.
Yes.
Now, hand...
Do you love me, Bobby?
I'll tell you...  ... l-a-t-e-r.
Is what you?
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
Would you tell her Bobby's here?
That's good.
Oh.
Daddy's very ill.
We can't all get up and leave, can we? I mean, there are certain needs you have to respond to...
I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
No, thanks...
Why are you being so mean?
Where's Catherine?!
I don't know where she is!
I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.
Bye, Robert.
Yes, intentionally.
Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
The day after tomorrow.
I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
Of course I do. It's music. You know...
Thank you.
It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
What?
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
Yes, that's what's important to me...
That's right.
Something witty and devastating like that.
Just give me a chance, will you?
What?
That's what I mean...
It's a Borzoi.
Don't call me "mack," honey.
What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
If you want to call it that.
Remember me, from the pool?
Me? No. Don't want none either. Such bastards, man.
Fa what?
Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
I'm not goin' to 10th Street, people piss and shit in that pool,
You know, Eddie's cousin.
You sure?
Probably.  One of the many.
Wha'?
Alan Stanwyk is not involved in improprieties. Where the hell does the S.E.C. come off --
Unbelievable.
God I admire you.
You mean her.
I wasn't asking.
Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
My God, you're serious.
Can I ask anybody now?
That's two.
Your aunt?
Just relax.
Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant.
No idea at all?
For sure?
Affirmative.
Oh my God!
It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
Till then.
Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.
Well, I'm fully covered.
Come on in.
Velma.
Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so.
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
What are you doing here?
They busted me last week.
What?
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.
You doing a story on this guy?
That's one thing I did find. It's from last month, so it was in the unsorted pile.
It's amazing.
Can I ask you a question?
Are you still in love with Alan?
No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
Long story.
What does all this mean?
Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
I'm calling the police. Right now.
Don't tell me I can't --
Tell the cops.
Practically.
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
Get out of here.
You'll have it.
I was upset.
I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
I don't have a sense of humor, either.  Sorry.
I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.
They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
I'll do my best.
Question one:  Can I have some money?  Kidding.  Why didn't you tell me about you and Johnny?  You two were into something even more dangerous than sex, weren't you? Who?  What?  Where?  How?  Now.
I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?
Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.
You gave it to the girls for one.
Hey, they blew me.
Why are all these people after me?
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
Who cares about people?
Okay?  I just blew up.  I feel orgasmic.
Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
Why have you come to my planet?
You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.
Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... <u>hey</u>!  Get that stick out of your mouth.  These things are killers, man.  Don't you go to school, listen to Smokey the Bear and all that...
Liar!  You don't care!  About anything.
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
Two words.  Disco Express.
Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
You were the lead sing -- Lieutenant, I didn't think anyone could cheer me up tonight... Thanks.  Really.
That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
Golly, I'd probably faint.
Ah, I didn't say seven <u>P</u>.M., now did I?
Ciao.
Julian, you're fired.
You're a poet and didn't know it.
Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
Boca?
Sal --
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
No... yeah...
Enchanté.  Alain, j'ai réfléchi à votre proposition et j'ai décidé d'accepter.
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Sois gentil avec lui.  On ne sait jamais.  Il peut te faire travailler à la télévision.
What difference does it make? We'll be out of the country Friday.
What?
I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.
Yeah!
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
Hey, I thought we come for a drink.
Come on -- just for fun --
Toy wit' this will ya.
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
Why is it called Hellgate?
I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
You remember Mary Finelli?
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
I'll go find Hayes.
Switches are shorted out.
Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
You give him his drops?
Wish you weren't.
I know.  He loves that thing.
Are you listening to me?  You're in a world of shit.  An eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment.  We got your prints all over the place.  Plus the fucking driver's license, Frank.  You gotta give me something here. Something I can believe.
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.
Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.
I'm doing it!  I'm doing it!
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
I got fed up with all the bullshit.
Oh, that was my kid.
What?
What if it's not...
I'm thirty-five years old.
1998.
Nah, I gave it up.
I think I'm losing you.
Why?
When?
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
We're okay...we're good, Dad.
Wow.
You there?
In my pocket.
Please, Dad, just do it.
Dad, you there?
Sully!  Is that you?
Huh?
What?
No.  What house you work?
Sullivan?
Would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?
Cool it, Andy.
Where's Shelly?
If you insist.
Barely.
What?
Sure.
This is all the exercise I need...
Don't do that to me!
Will you come with me?
A hammock?
You're irresistible.  I lose control.
Nothing.
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a little strange to you?
And, what about us?
Sure, just watch where you're going.
Destroy the evidence, Pronto!
Stop worrying.  I don't think they'll bother to come after us.
Maybe.
Just keep your eyes on the road.
I just want you to like me.
Who's Horace?
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
Why?
Better call an ambulance first.
Whaddya mean?
You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
Megan, get away from him.  He's dangerous.
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
All he's asking is for you to check it out.
Daddy, what is going on?
I already have a very good idea what could've happened...  ...Megan, Jason is out there.  He has to be stopped.  I'm positive he's heading back to the lake area.  He'll keep killing until...
What's it to ya?
Why?
It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
Yes.  And I said, hand me those padlocks.
That's debatable.
You gotta be kidding!
I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
Skin stretcher was human.
-- yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just have your hundred grand ready.  For that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
No.  Not here.  Come by my house tonight at eleven.  Don't be late.
Yes.
Not so bad, today.
Do you have to ask?
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
Goddamnit!
Tell me!
You think you can lock me up in this piss-ass prison?  Hell, this place is motel fuckin' six to me.
She's yours?
What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
Until I hear the truth.
-- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
Oh, you stupid, sorry son-of-a- bitch...
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
Really?
My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
I guess not.
No.
Don't be ridiculous!
Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen.
You can and you will!!
I don't know what to say...
I gathered that.
Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
Give me the degrees first, followed by minutes and sec...
Where are they?
Where you're going, mister?
I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
That's where I peed.
Quietly effective.
Press a button and they give us money.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
Do not inhale.
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
Here we go.
Where is it?
Had to be him.
I hear Alan's sick.
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
The Red Sox
It can't be all that personal.
In and out of bed.
Because we're completely mismatched.
I don't have a date. I don't want a date.
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
Names are incredibly intimate. We barely know each other. Trust me on this.
First you tell me.
A flat-out hit.
What do we want?
You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name?
What else?
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
Be open with me. I'd like that.
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
This could be it!
Life is real.
Where the hell are you?
It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
I lost it. I lose everything.
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
You tell your friends your father used to work the docks. Callused hands. But you had an attitude when you were growing up that wasn't easy for your mother and me to understand.
Matthew's my grandson.
You're charming the boy.
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
Yes.
And he has finer moments now and then.
Engaging.
Alla puttanesca.
Home.
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
Yes.
They are boys. -- And they're Indian.
Mr. Khan said they called you brave.
"I will follow close behind you and help to serve the people."
Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way. I'm far too modest for such a display.
Well, he must've found some of the answers...
Well, I don't know how you got a ticket for --
I've never spoken for anything else.
It was one incident.
Tell that to the families of the policemen who died.
He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
That's right. The word only means "community." But it could stand for "village"... or the world.
Hm.  Is it?
Perhaps. I've come here to think about it.
First spin. Let the others march for a time.
I don't know... I know you are right. I don't know that this is right.
No... no. In every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other.
Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done.
Somehow I expected not.
I congratulate them.
Who's leading them?
Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
There are a few million miles to go yet.
Now is your chance to find out.
You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?
Blood.  From the vein.
Something's not right.
What a relief.
I will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission.  We're already counting backwards.
He's too tall.
Wrong color.  It's silver.  It's not easy living up to this.
Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent.
How long do you stay up there before you go?
A day or so.
--I walked right in front of it.  I was never more sober in my life.
Where?
Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up".  What's wrong with her?
You may as well invite her here.
Will you be okay?
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
No, but you might need them when you get back.
German, is that you?
Vincent, come down.  I've found him.
That's the hair color in his profile?
I'd have to bleach my hair.
There's a way.
Not that.
Last night?  I was at home.
I was at home.
Why don't we say we were together?
Friend?
You celebrate, Jerome?
Of course.
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
I'll take care of my end.
That's right.
No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
It looks fine.
What do you mean? You've never been there.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
Whisky and a peach.
That's not all of it.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
We've got time. We've got a lot of time. I can help you.
Is he straight?
Want to cry now?
At least you were outside.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
... and live happily ever after.
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
There wasn't any way to explain it.
We keep going.
He must have.
Like what?
Yeah.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
You were with him?
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
Just sandwiches...
Right.
Not now.
You serious?
Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
Yes.
Was the steering faulty?
What about?
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it.
Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
Jack...
What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
No. No. It's not like that. I've got a husband, you know.
I can't.
Nicer than most.
Though nicer than most?
What?
I work for him.
Oh yes. When he came up on business.
Yes, while he was here.
Was he?
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
Is he coming here?
Did my brother Frank find out?
Your brother? What you talking about?
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
No.
No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
Is he staying the night?
Funny.  Can I phone London?
No.
You wouldn't.
Think about it.
Oh, that's nice.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
Oh, you've been watching television.
Still got a sense of humour?
Yep.
Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
We've got to take you back to London.
The gun he means.
Three hundred altogether, Harry.
You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"
Mmm...
What?
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
It's too...
It's not right.
No.  That's absolutely right.
...cower in his boots...
Yes.
Nurses.
He is?
Yes.
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
You...
What?
Somebody...
That's what I'm saying.  We were, if we were that kind of guys, to knock it off, and trash the joint, it looks like robbery, and take the fuckin' leads out of the files...go to Jerry Graff.
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
Yes.
How do you know he'd buy them?
No.  Not actually.
What will he pay?
Why would they come to me?
No.
...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
Absolutely.
Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
That's none of your fucking business...
Everything I...you know...
He said he filed...
They stole...
Were the leads insured?
A waste of time?  Why?
In school.
'Cause, you know, 'cause they weren't, I know that Mitch and Murray uh...
I didn't...why should I..."Where were you last..." Is anybody listening to me...?  Where's Moss...?  Where...?
Excuse me, sir...
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
Marshal the leads...marshal the leads?  What the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the leads.  What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is that?  Where did you learn that?  In school?  That's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm the man to sell.  I'm getting garbage.  You're giving it to me, and what I'm saying is it's fucked.
...let me...are you listening to me...?
The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
Murray said...
I were you, I'd calm down, Shelly.
Yes.  I hear you.
What'd you do with the leads?  You want to go in there?  I tell him what I know, he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night?  You better have one. What did you do with the leads?  If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.
Uh-huh?
Call up the bank.  I called them.
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
They...
My wife told me to look into...
Home cooking...
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?
Mm.
What do I...?
To...you know.
Of course you have three days.
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
That's what they are.  Three business...I wait till Monday, my time limit runs out.
When did you write the check?
Tuesday.
And when was that check cashed?
Tell me again.  Your wife.
I...
She told me I had to get back the check or call the State's att...
And the check is...
Fuck the Machine.
You did that?
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
No, where is it?
Just a few days.
Why do you have to go?
That's right.
 He's going to kill Fanucci.
Then why do you come to me?
No.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
No, Dad.
Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
Yeah, some deal I made.
Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey, what's with the food?  Some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver. 'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver.' Go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or I'll send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners!
Count on me; that's my specialty.
Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.
It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I can handle things.  I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
He's an Italian?
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
 And he agreed?
That's off now.
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
Why didn't someone tell me!
No, I have confidence in their loyalty... but this is life and death, and Tom, you are my brother.
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
I don't know.
Good.  Then you're staying.
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
How do I know you haven't gone into business for yourself?
You're right.
Yeah, that was a good break.  A nice deal.
He is, I believe, a brother.
The witness is excused; take him out.
I'm going to the market.
Sleeping inside me.
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
Where can we talk?
You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
There are still things I have to do.
Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?
You talk about the baby.  She can have another baby.
The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
Technically, they are still under the Clemenza wing of the Corleone Family, now run by Frankie Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died, the Rosatos wanted territory of their own.  Pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them.  I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down.  Pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. I was lucky and he was stupid. I'll visit him soon.  The important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans, yours and mine.  This thing of ours, that we will build.
Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
Then you have to trace it.  Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man.  I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man.  But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me.  You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
There was this kid that I grew up with; he was a couple years younger than me, and sort of looked up to me, you know.  We did our first work together, worked our way out of the street.  Things were good and we made the most of it.  During prohibition, we ran molasses up to Canada and made a fortune; your father too.  I guess as much as anyone, I loved him and trusted him. Later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop-over for G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast. That kid's name was Moe Greene, and the city he invented was Las Vegas. This was a great man; a man with vision and guts; and there isn't even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town.  Someone put a bullet through his eye; no one knows who gave the order.  When I heard about it I wasn't angry.  I knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong, and talking loud, and saying stupid things.  So when he turned up dead, I let it go, and said to myself: this is the business we've chosen. I never asked, who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business.
No, I'm fine.
How is his health?
That is a complete falsehood.
I do not.
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
He did business...but he never trusted him.
I was just going to contact you, Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' - in fact, I just come from there.
Keep them alive.
What about Michael Corleone?
He supports me.
Eh...  Five dollars more.
Yes.
Why is everybody giving me crap tonight?
We're watching the movie, Harry. You got that!  We are watching my fucking movie.
Weird.
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
Sure.  I loved it.
Damn straight.  I'm sick of playing games.
You will not hurt him?
The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
Your wife?
Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks.
Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time.
I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
All right already.  I'll take it off.  Kind of warm in here anyway.
Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
No.  At least not in the legal sense.
But we have to match the other sketch.
It's so far in the past now.  Over fifteen years --
You've done a helluva lot more than most people.
Can't you see?  It's raining!
I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
What was that?
I haven't done a damn thing with you!
No, I don't want to die alone.  But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable.  They say you never see the one with your name on it.  But I want to see death coming at me.  I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face.  Your face.  Think, Clayton.  You'd be my second Monster.  Almost as famous as the first.  It would be the great adventure you've yearned for. A war story for both of us to share.
Good.  Fine.
I just want to watch it, okay?
It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane.
I did.  But Princess Margaret was a doll.  We're all equals in her eyes.  As commoners, I presume.
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
But the rest of it?  The killing headaches.  The phantom smells.  My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity?
Luminal.
Sure.
Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
You're serious.
That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
Of course.
Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
No, but you dress like an asshole ...
One more night --
He'll live. But it means your boy's behind it. Astricky was holding a list. They just faxed it to us...
What for?
Yes, Kip. Short for Kipling. Named for the English writer of stories about India ... He bites into his pear ... Memphis says nothing, waits ...
What are you still doing here, Randall?
Your girl works in there ...
Consider me gone, Detective --
No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
You seem a little hinked-up ...
What color?
Jonathan Quayle Higgins ...
All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
And there she is --
Yeah...
There's no one left ...
We don't -- ?
No.
You getting my checks ... ?
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
What do you say, Toby?,
Hey, now -
You spread it out, by the 2nd night, the heat are onto you. Know something's up. With a one-night boost, by the time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship's set sail.
That's a good attitude, Kip. For everything but stealing cars ...
What for -- ?
Call 'em here -- ?
I left town. I didn't leave you.
And you got some Italians -- ?
What's wrong with her -- ?
No ...
Her parole officer strongly recommended it ...
I know. But let's prep 'em. We could stay here all night... That wouldn't be good --
Let me worry about The Club ...
I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me
Go to them. They'll be happy to see you ... Ahhh...
His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
I'll see you soon --
Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ...
Oooh, ain't you the lucky duck --
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
Let her carry this shit inside.
He told me to take the kids to the police station and make the cops put me on welfare.
With what?
Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
I got scared.
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
I gotta talk to you.
Don't worry about it.
Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.
He heard.
I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
Just make sure you do it. You know what I mean?
Tommy  ...
I know. I know. But it'll be okay. Don't worry. I got some money for you. It's down the block.
Look. He's got the whole house in an uproar.
No, he was so hammered that he drove the police cruiser home. Fuckin' lights and everything!
You're fuckin' good.
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
Yeah, it is.
How much money you got?
I think you should establish a good line of credit.
I'm Irish.
Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
Come now...what do you think I am, a juvinile? You don't got any money on you right now. You think I'm gonna take a check? EXECUTIVE It's fine, John, I can cover the rest.
Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.
Why shouldn't I work for the National Security Agency? That's a tough one.
And what do you see?
With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
The limit is not found!  The limit is not found.
Hey fuck you.
Of course.
Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.
Then don't set up any more meetings.
I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.
Sam called me. From Tri-tech. He says you start working for them next week.
Bullshit.
Since Nancy died.
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
I need someone with your kind of background.
My kind of background?
He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
Can we do it at my office?
To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
--And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
I don't know. India maybe.
You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
What do you want to do?
Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will.
Will, your not getting off that easy.
Like what, Will?
What?
You're getting defensive...Henry. And hey, cheif--tell the wife, at least. Christ, set her free.
Probably not.
Crayons?
Watch your mouth.
No.
Why thank you.
Fine.
Haven't called her.
I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
When did you know she was the one?
October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.
So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?
I know.
It's not...
I know, I know...
Yeah, I think so.
Okay, sounds good.
You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?
Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
Yes you were.
Pretty boring, I guess.
How many?
Do you know all their names?
Do you keep in touch with them?
Exactly.
I'd say...  It's only four in the mornin', they're prob'ly up.
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
Come with me to California.
Well, you ain't a-goin'! Ain't *nobody* else a-goin'! We *got* here an' we gonna *stay* here, together! As long as we got the fambly unbroke I ain't scared, but it's a long bitter road we got ahead of us--  --an' I'm here to tell ya ef anybody else tries to bust us up anymore I'm a-goin' cat wild with this here piece a bar-arn!
Now I can't breathe.
Them was nickel apiece candy.
Sure, but what is this?
Four.
Two.
Kids?
Government.
Anything like work aroun' here?
Goodnight.
Been out travelin' around?
And you ain't ashamed?
They never wrote you nothing?
I never heard nothin' about it.
I ain't gonna run.
I aim to.
They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
I hear it. I think they's some guys comin' this way, lots of 'em. We better get outa here.
Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else?
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
Yeah.
That's where I get off.
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.
This here's a strike.
Yes, ma'am.
Ain't nothin' the matter. I just ain't a-goin', that's all.
And can't nobody *make* me go, either! Ain't nobody here *man* enough to make me! I'm a-stayin'.
Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.
But will it--hurt the baby?
An' you won't let nobody touch me?
No, Ma. I'm paroled. I got my papers.
We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?
Don't taste bad.
That's right. And douse some in it.
No.
On a gallon a gas?  Let's set up the tent. Maybe I can fix us up some stew.
You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.
I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
Comes night we'll get outa here.
I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
But who done it?
But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now.  The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.
Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
Why, she wasn't no more'n a kid when I went up.
Easy. After all, they ain't but about *twelve* of us, is they?
You're tootin' we're gonna stay. 
Aw, sure. This here's jus' a part of it. Ain't no sense a gettin' scairt right off.
I wisht it was day.
I never--
Well, there's plenty of work for you about forty miles north, this road just outside Pixley. Turn east on 32 and look for Hooper's ranch. Tell 'em Spencer sent you.
I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
Whatever I can get away with.
Computer guy.
Correct.  That's for you. Keep it.
Ten years, I think. What I miss?
That's it?
Not much else.
That'd be good.
You're fucking psycho.
As long as I get the laugh.
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
Like love?
Could be. The physical substance of love.
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
You don't understand...
Other people can't.
They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say?  "I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork."
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
What stuff?
If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right?
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
Wait a minute--
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
He using her.
If he does our job, he's our job.
I get it.
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
I'll pay.
They were very upset.
You have a headache?
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
Fair enough.
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
No.
Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?
That's good.
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
What's that to miss?
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.
College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
It is. It's lovely.
Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
Just make yourself comfortable.
I don't care! We'd be together.
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
Fine!
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
Did he tell you that?
I think they call it a pasture.
Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Why should they?
Tom's gone.
Who's there?
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
If this magazine is so important to you Annie, why are you in Montana?
Hi.
When are you coming home?
How are you feeling about work?
Let's not talk about that now.
No. I am a "tubab."
Where to?
Always did. I think she favored him a little. You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same.
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
Yes, it does.
He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
Ain't brain surgery.
Uh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother around?
I know where he goes.
There's no hurry. Take you time.
So?
Can I come? I'll start a fire...
I just could never say it!
NO!
Oh-oh... Maybe I better get back in the truck.
How long were you married?
Sometimes.
Well, if the rider's nuts, the horse bolts.  That's the whole lesson right there. You have a good day now... Just... keep on freeing yourself up.
It's not cool. It's commie bullshit!
Hackers of the World, Unite!
Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
That's far out!
A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
Go fix the phones.
Curtis.
What are you doing?
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
Nah. I don't play well with others.
We did it!
I'm Crash Override.
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
I'll make it up to you!
How?
We need your help to overload the Gibson so we can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the worm program.
Thanks for your help.
Yeah.
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
Yeah? You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.
Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
We caught 'em.
Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer?
Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display!
The rabbit is in the administration system.
D'you bring those Crayola books?
You think they're going to bust us?
Someone didn't bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords. Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for most used passwords are love,  sex, secret and...  ...God. So would your holiness care to change her password?
Excuse me?
Congratulations.
Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
555-4202.
You do? Okay. Go down aisle A. We've got the best costumes in the whole town.
My parents baby-sitter canceled.
Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit
I don't know!
We're trapped in this house.
An accident?
Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.
Like a sister?
I'm sorry I ruined everything. If I wasn't here you could go out.
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
Double scoops. Now lets get some breakfast.
In a second.
It was the nightmare man
Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
Yeah.
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got.
Loomis. Haddonfield.
Sort of.
Now you understand?
Don't touch him Jamie!
The only things missing were some Halloween masks, rope, a set of knives. What does that sound like to you?
That's not true. Here I am.
Sure.
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
I have a place for that.
Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep!
Why did you hang up on me?
Annie, was that you?
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
I wasn't spooked.
Annie!
I don't know.
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
Yeah.
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
Where?
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
What about the bogyman?
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
Right.
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?
Tommy, let me in!
What is it, Laurie?
You're coming with us...
Yes, she is.
What does that mean?
Shouldn't we pick him up?
Great.
Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
And you, you-you're going?
Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny.  But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm.
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
Ah! HOLLY  Now.
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
It's nothing.  Will you trust me?
I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
Could you--
Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
Oh, I don't know.  My unemployment checks are running out.  Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.
Where are you headed?
No!  No...
No, I don't think so.
Oh, yeah.
But I go nuts.  It's a conflict.
Yes, he's just adorable.
Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
It's so late.
Why not?
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
Leave me alone, can you?!
Get his wine away.
I am glad to see you.
We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
Yeah.
You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz.  More gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.
I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
Oh...
I can't keep my mind on the show.
A week ago, I bought a rifle.
I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.
Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  That makes everything...
Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap.
He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test. 
Oh, yeah?  How's she doing?
I got two minutes.
He's fine.
Yeah.
That's a beauty!
What, by a st-stranger?
The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
Yeah, I know, Mom. NORMA  But I, I knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes.  He's all show!  Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?!
This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts.
Two thousand dollars.
Are we talking about cocaine again?
Oh, perfect!  He reminds me of Ichabod Crane.  His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. HANNAH  Listen.  He's a lot better than your ex-husband.  He's got a good job.  Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything.
Oh!
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
Really?
No, I'm sorry.  No, I didn't mean that.  No, I didn't mean that.
No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
So what's new?
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
Yeah, that's clerical.
I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm trying to be helpful.  A person doesn't just say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress.  Now I'm a writer."  I mean--
What's the matter?
No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
My--uh...
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
I remember you.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
Yeah.
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
Nobody ever said it.
This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?
Oh.  Oh.
Oh, well.
Oh, who cares?
It's all right.
Hi.  How you doin'?
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
Uh-huh.
Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
We could skip the Gavotte.
There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you... 
I know her by the Back.
Who called the <u>TV CREWS</u>...?
He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
Impossible.
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
First things first.
The puppy comes back.  If you lie on the ground.  The Puppy with return.  Why? Do you know why...?  TO KILL YOU.  IT THINKS YOU HAVE FALLEN AND ARE POWERLESS. IT COMES BACK TO TEAR YOUR THROAT. THAT'S WHY THE CHILD TURNED BACK.  As Lechter will return back.  You see?  To the sight of his oppressor <u>wounded</u>. He will return to savage our beloved Miss Starling.  Bring me a drink.
That operation has begun.  Are we God, that we would <u>Meddle</u> with it...?  <u>No</u>, on the <u>other</u> hand...
Good evening, Dr. Lechter.  Thank you for coming.  I am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances.
Awright.
And how would you know that?
Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study. 
...young boys, still...?
I can make you rich.
Come on, Doctor, <u>then</u> you can sleep...
'fraid it's too late.
A fellow with five fingers.
I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
What is that supposed to mean...?
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
I <u>sense</u>...  The faintest <u>whiff</u> of a perfume, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u> is "Hamamelis" ... it is <u>witch-hazel</u>--such a clean scent.  No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?
Enchante.
Yes, of course, and we'll <u>collect</u> them. I won't be a minute...
Yes.... yes...
...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
Oh, no, no.  It won't be <u>that</u> long.
No, I don't get you...
Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
And what would be of Greater Help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence.  DON'T YOU THINK?  IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND UNIMAGINATIVE, DON'T YOU <u>THINK</u>?  BLIND HIM AGAIN, AND PREPARE <u>HIM AND HER</u> FOR THE PIGS! 
...might I make a suggestion...?
I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
...and that is what you need to expand.
We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
....because we don't have any mmm...
...what did you want? 
I know where he is.
What shape is the scar?
No,I get it, this is my <u>Cavalier</u>.  This gents my Italian Knight.  Take <u>this</u>...  For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.
They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
<u>Someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head. 
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
This is...this is...a very special moment...
What are you gonna do about it?

I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
Iunno.
Don't worry, you...
I should leave. You probably need your rest.
Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
Geez, don't listen to them.
Never say never.
Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
Jealous much?
Yeah, I just got back.
Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
Suicide is a private thing.
Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
"To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."
They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.
Of course.
Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
No-o!
Answer him dick!
Let's kick his ass.
I think so, man.
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
People just don't take the name Heather seriously. They should, shouldn't they?
Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.

frowns at Henry.
leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.
I'm not hungry.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
But she'll have no one to look after her!
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.
Fruit.
God, yes!
I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage!
Mummy!
I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!
Bull...
Okay so... what's the safest place?
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
I understand... I won't-
Since what?
What?
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
Bret. What the hell is going on?
I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. 
Where's Allison?
Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
Gwen, my wife's dead.
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.
For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
Two.
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
You should always listen to your subconscious. It's trying to tell you something about your waking life.
Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
I was in the can, for Chrissake.
I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...
Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie... I mean there's no way I can promise anything.  I can't tell him what we're up to...
Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
He gives a good report and I walk?
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
It's November.
Some of it.  Right here.  I got some of it.  I'll get the rest as soon as I can.
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
Mister LaPlante...
Look, I got this kid.  We got a goddamn relationship!  I'm takin' him to a movie tonight!  He worships me.  If I go down what's this do to my son?  I'm his goddamn role model for Christ sake!
Is he here, your friend.  The fireman?
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
What's your scheme, Mister LaPlante? What are you forcing John Bubber to do?  What are you -- ?
He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
-- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...?
Underbelly!
I'm working on that.  It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter?
Yeah.  I'll see ya... dad.
You were saying you don't want a million dollars.
You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'
John, I know all about it.
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
WHAT?  THEY FOUND WHAT?
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
For ten more minutes they love him, Wally.  I'm sick of him and I'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public.
Half the time he don't answer even if he's home.  Know why?  'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him.  I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends.  Who's gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin' him a favor on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin you get on my set, Miss Gayley?  Purple! That's what color skin you got on the tee vee LaPlante sells me!
He's pretty... remarkable.
They're really white.
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
Oh no -- I mean, she's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways -- and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things, too.  What I mean is, I guess I'm still waiting for just that right -- synthesis between us -- where everything will be understood between us without even the need for words.
I should.
Right.
"Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck!"
Aw, okay.
So you don't have anything concrete?
What?
What?
Honey, are you okay?
No.

Where should I hide the car keys?
I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.
Oh baby.
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
Oh, honey.
I'm <u>fired</u>.  I'm unemployed.  Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength?  Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off!
I think it's time I came home now.
No.
Really.
Yeah -- how'd you know that?
Really?  I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley.  A crime was committed in New York City?  That is news.
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
I don't need proof.  I know it.  Send it out.
Why?
I learned my fill from Romeriz.
What?
That is a thought that doesn't please me.
I do not know.  I pray that I shall never have to raise my sword against one that I call friend.
What worries you?
No -- after you.
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
Your life.
Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
I cannot explain.
Do you love me, Conner?
Then take me with you.
Huge.
Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
In the highlands?
I don't know.
New York is dangerous place.
Have you ever heard of the Calan?
Sorry.
Is it?
You don't really believe this do you?
And the other one -- he is like you?
It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
No.
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
And I you.  Go now.  Let me walk to heavens door alone.
Don't shout, Larry.  I'm three feet away.
That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
Keep trying.
What do you want to do?
Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
It's happening right now.
Am I talkin' raghead?!  I want your car! <u>Gimme the goddamned keys</u>!
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
I didn't know he would have a gun!  It just went off!
I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
What hospital?
I think you got no choice.
I still see that boy's eyes.
But they're not here yet.  Tell me about <u>you</u>.
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
Shh, they'll hear you!
He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
I can't go without Thomas.
Just one question.  Please.
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
Another minute.  Please --
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
He didn't say.
We only have eight officers on duty, Chief.
They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.
Order your men to stand down.
No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.
Yes, sir.
I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
Where's the office?
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
Can you get into the office?
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
You can let go.
These disks . . . where are they?
Smith will know.
I'll give you a hundred thousand francs for all of them.
I'm sorry, I can't possibly take them Paul. I'm overrun with refugees. As soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them.
They're only taking the whites.
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
The police are very busy.
Whiskey?
Get in.
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
When?
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
When the Europeans left, their soldiers gathered lists.
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
No whiskey, no spirits. Your rich cockroaches at the hotel, they will have to do without their scotch. Anyway, I have bled that cow enough Paul.
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
This goes out live?
Why sir?
The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.
Call, sir?
What?
What cards?
They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.
Of course.
Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
I couldn't help.
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
I'll try.
We have been abandoned.
What for Paul.
Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now.
I had you transferred to Kigali.
A car.
A Volkswagen.
There is one thing I need right away.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
That is why they call it coach?
What! Paul storms off.
Sir, no one wants to work. They say the boss has left.
The lieutenant wants the register.
When?
As the trucks go.
We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel.
Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
I'm confused.
You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.
Can't imagine by who. I don't suppose the truth would interest you: that I've never had another wife but Evelyn.
I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation!
I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
Why not?
No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
-- that's the fact, bud --
-- listen to the man --
Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
Where is she?
-- wit...nesses --
Steven??
-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
And then what happens?
What?
You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.
Good way to get your head blown off.
I'll try not to remember to warn Evelyn.
-- I'll take the chance, come morning and cops, I'll be proved right --
I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just...
This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
Over here.
Melissa...?
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
What was her name?
That poor little girl.
Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...
Yes.
She's down...how do you mean honey?
Where is she now?
That's great, honey.
Good night daddy.
Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
What will Aubrey think?
Well something just happened to the power upstairs... Maura heads off and shakes her head, troubled by the event -
Oh come on!
I'm being realistic.  Look, I have a spiritual side.  I mean, we had a priest come in and bless the house.  That should count for something.
Aubrey?!  Aubrey?!
No...  NO!
Well that's what we're here for. I mean -
Maura.
Yeah, they told us this was the best.
It will not take long...
Not really.  Oh, wait a minute.
And I believe what you say.  But this is TV.  No pictures, no story.
And what is ... this frozen moment?
He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
What happened to him?
What is it?
I'm trying to quit.
No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...
Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns.
Wow.  Thank you.
Right.  Like you were hog-tied or something.
No!  No.  It's not the same ... I ... No.  What you did ... it was ... evil.
Because you want to.  You've always wanted to.  Look at your pictures.  Look at your sculptures.  Look at those tawdry representations and then ... Imagine.  Imagine a world of the body as canvas.  The body as clay.  Your will and mine as the brush and the knife. Oh, I have such sights to show you.
JP?
Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--
Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
Morning edition.  Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight.
But I said I was sorry....
"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
Anna, I think you better stay....
Yes way.
You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
Quit bitching, you got the employee of the month plaque for that shit...Ah to be in Pari-is and in love.
Yeah.  The big E.
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
Excuse me, Milady.  I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners.
Oh.  No.
It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
Trust Leonardo....
Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
Million five, lover...
So when's that Sebastian-Cabot- Buckingham-Palace-looking- Butlerhead getting here?
If you think you're getting past me...
Yeah, right.  By the way, as long as I'm getting things off my chest, I'm the one who killed your little monkey.  Made it look like a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun. Ciao.
Well, maybe I --
I'm happy enough.
Lumbago.
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
The couch, please.
I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
Well, it's done now -- what's the use of grousing about it. Forget the letter, Amy, I just had to blow off some steam...
Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy. You're the one person who's been standing by me through all this.
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
Your i --
Now, Aim --
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
Watch it, Archer --
He grins wolfishly.
I'm sure you do.
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
This you're familia' with.
Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?
Yeah, but, buddy --
Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster!
But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
Say, that was a swell idea!
Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal.
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
Get your feet off that desk.
But, sir!
Well... I'm for it...
Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company...
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
At the Houmfort.
That's nonsense, Alma.
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
You mean a figurehead.
Nonsense, child!  I know Wesley's been drinking too much lately.  I know a great deal more about what goes on at Fort Holland than you'd think.  I know all about you -- that you're a nice girl, competent and kind to Jessica.  The Fort needs a girl like you.  But now we've got to get you back there.  I'll walk you back and stay over night.  It'll be a nice change for me.
Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
You don't believe in it?
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
Mrs. Rand was at the Houmfort that night.  But there's nothing wrong with that.  She's gone there for years -- trying to take care of those people,  to help them.
Is this disease common in the tropics?
Fortunately, not.  This is my first experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies.  I am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.
That will mean another interview, won't it?
It'll wait.
Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
No, thank you.  Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---
Well, I had a good time up to a point.
Ah -- that's where reason took hold.
You were possessed.  That is true -- possessed by your subconscious mind.  You were in the Houmfort, surrounded by their symbols.  To them, nothing worse can happen to a person than to be made into a Zombie.  Your subconscious mind used their own words for evil.
Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case.
Emotion tricks all of us, Mrs. Rand.  And you are a woman with a very strong conscience.  That conscience has been tormenting you. The rest is coincidence.  There is no such thing as a Zombie.  The dead do not come back to life. Death is final.
It doesn't matter what you call it. I can tell you right now Jessica isn't going!
That night, I went to the Houmfort. I kept seeing Jessica's face -- smiling -- smiling because two men hated each other -- because she was beautiful enough to take my family in her hands and break it apart. The drums seemed to be beating in my head.  The chanting -- the lights --  everything blurred together.  And then I heard a voice, speaking in a sudden silence.  My voice.  I was possessed.  I said that the woman at Fort Holland was evil and that the Houngan must maker her a Zombie.
No thank you. We should be off.
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
So early?
That shirt?
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
What do you mean?
That this was going to be a key party?
You're not going to --
I'm not.
We'll talk in the morning.
What you been up to?
Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?
-- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --
-- 73
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the list?
Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --
Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
Mikey Williams?
We were just riding around.
I suppose. Why?
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
Yes.
You're saying that Christ is the child, and --
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
The water, as you call it, is a special mixture of amaretto and Ben&Ben blended for just the exact chemical interaction with the last of our precious Thai stick.
Major.
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!
They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
Sure.  Twinkie?
Yeah. Yours?
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to.
Charles. Have you been keeping out of my shit? Have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room?
Watching what?
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
Is this Charles?
Right.
Yeah? See ya.
All my model planes.
The ones you built?
What are you doing?
Okay.
That's the name for when you wake up and find this little pool of sticky stuff, like after a sexy dream.
Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
It's only gonna make you crazy.
Don't worry about him...
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
One word to I.A. and he walks.
Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
Huh?
Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
What kind of stuff?
What are you doing in this shit-hole town?
Best friend?
Yes.
You're not following procedure.
Procedure went out the window a long time ago.
But how did you come into existence?
Nothing if not vampires...
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
Yes I knew him. Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing.
What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
But you're the fairest by far.
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
Not you my dear.
Louis, put me in my coffin...
Why does he call you that?
Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
I can't. Go away from me.
Still my beautiful child.
And no one knows but us...
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!
Call him.
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
Because you're as strong as I was when I was alive.
You have fed. You were made for this...
We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?
Yes. And I'm bored with this prattle --
Paris? You came from Paris?
As did the one who made me.
I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?
Respect me a little then. I'm the only life you know.
I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
Ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, I am like a mother tonight. I want a child.
I tried...
Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
You're not lying to me, are you?
You can't look at them...
I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.
No way, man. Surprise her. She'll be psyched.
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
No.
Not me...no way...
Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
I've got to see.
No, you're not.
Yeah.
It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
You know me to well.
Wait, it's Nancy --
I'm fine.
You sure?
You don't seem fine.
It beets being on the mainland.
Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.  I'm going to take a walk and dry off.
Are you sure? I really appreciate it.
Did you get help?
I guess so.
Just for a minute, baby. I got something I wanna tell you.
Hello?
I said we start having fun. And that means now.
Well, there's some flaws in her...
Cool.
Very well. I'll wager a dinner.
I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.
I'm afraid so. There were rumors ——people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
I donut understand.
That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.
I think not.
No one can take my father's place.
What an odd question!
What is it -- what are you talking about?
I will let him go. He is dead to me as he is to all my mother's people. I turn my hand against him.
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep —- I want to avoid it.
I don't understand you.
Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
Her family name?
She's not too well.
Maybe you've got the wrong crypt —— after all it's twenty years when you wore last here.
It is not necessary to understand. We are leaving and I am thankful.
Everything's so simple. I like you.
Why in the world can't you?
So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
All right –– all right.
Our clothes are dry.
You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right.
There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy . . . 
Well, keep your eyes open. See the town?
Splendid! Is he sick?
You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
Looks like we'll have to send someone down –– a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
Mother . . .
All right, all right. Here, give Daddy the flower. I'll give it a drink.
Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.
Oh, now, don't rub it in.
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
Hmmmm . . .
No.
No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
Maybe you were born older, George.
No, I'll settle for half that in cash.
Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
I know, but . . .
How do you do.
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
George . . .
Yeah . . .  . . . you can take this one off now.
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
We'll save them for seed. A toast!
You like it? I'll send you a box.
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
About what?
Where's your coat and hat?
Left them at the office.
What?
You going to the lighthouse?
With butter, if they got any....
What the hell, we're steering for it.
It's okay, it's okay.  What's the matter?  Tina?  Honey?  Hey ---
It's still there!
Then check it out.  I'll be in the office.
If you had a $100,000 boat there'd be an investigation.
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
If there is, develop it!
Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there.
What about tennis?  Riding? fixing up old cars?  Bartending?
Okay, okay -- stand over there....
All of us thank you, okay?
Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer.  Don't you have any pull with the chief, here?
Temporarily?  Uh...sure....
Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.
Don't be ridiculous -- Sharks don't take things personally.
Late.
I can see that. Don't you know this is a big deal?
My boss and your boss.  Sure.
Better yet.
So's a donut.
Damn.
That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
I know you did....
Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
I know, I know....
And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.
Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
What for?
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
Hiya yourself.
I want you to meet my cousin.
I love it.
Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
You're going sailing.
Maybe.
I'm not in the way.  Andy, am I in the way?
Maybe nobody will notice.  Let's get them back in the bus.
Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
You buying?
Sure am.
My imagination isn't that good.
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
Michael, the sub's dead.
Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.
What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
I think so.  I'm not sure... Are you?
It's all right, baby.  We're safe...
We'll go to Palm Springs, Death Valley, Arizona desert, anyplace where there's no water.
Recovering nicely.
You don't.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
Michael, I don't have time. Please!  It's time you dealt with this and got over it.  Now come on!
I can't take water, Kathryn.
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
Me.
Michael, you're not going down there.
It's a construction job.  I'm the only one that can do it.
Make this quick!
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
We're taking that shark alive!
Because I don't trust you, that's why.
Why are you?
That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.
The grenade's just to intimidate Whitey.  He knows I have it, so he watches out.  Same is true when I film lions, tigers, rhinos...
He.  She.  Let's blow the bitch up!
Ten minutes ago.
I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.
'Course they're also so rich.
No.  Of course not.  Don't listen to him.  He's - he's...  ... my brother.
I don't know, what else is there?
Yes, it's great!
Come on, it's fun!
Goes up.
Take it up.
He's diving!
SEAN!
Hold still, damn it!
I thought I was your boyfriend.
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
It's not closing, Mike.
Sharks???
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
Gee, it's good to see you!
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
We're in love.
Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
Turn it off....
I've always wanted to make love to an angry welder.  I've dreamed of nothing else since I was a small boy.
But it went away...We would have known....
It went away....
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
I always thought when I grew up I'd know what to do about things like this...I don't even know if he's serious....
I don't know what he thinks...I don't know what I think...I don't even know why I'm talking about it...  It's silly...I'm getting too old for this sort of thing....
You make sure they come?
Spent it all on beer....
He heard that.
I won't....
Thank you....
I'm still five....
I didn't.
Mother....
You guys must be starving....
It's Jake's actually...Our floating lab....
You were a monkey....
Will you let me finish.  I've been working on this all day.
I'm fine....
If you don't take it, we'll be swimming in a minute.
A big one....
You're always taking time off....
My vision is perfect....
She'll be all right, partner.. She'll never find it.  We couldn't....
You sure you know how to do this.
Hell, no.  What kind of pilot do you think I am...?
Good news travels fast....
What's that....?
You don't have to say anything, Matt ...I know how you feel....
Inch by inch....
It was like having snow in the house ...Jesus, I miss them.
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
Money is money....
They put bombs on dolphins....
Don't say anything about this to my mother....
The shark will get it for us.
As long as he's been here....
Hoagie.
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
I've got to get to her....
If we're real lucky, it'll eat itself....
Don't flatter yourself.... 
In a few minutes....
Who grows more beautiful....
I told you....
You want to be careful how you talk to me... I'm about to become famous...You should see....
What? Whatta you mean, no? Who is -- who is telling you? Whatta you mean, no? Yes, you'll wear pink or else. Or else you'll wear pink.  And, darlin', oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island.
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
The <u>dogs</u>?
O.K.
There's nothing in the files?
Find yourself a farmer's daughter with nice big fucking tits, and shake that "bye-bye." Send it to Sacramento, John .. I sniff grief ..
A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar ..
Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
So am I. But where's my money?
I haven't got it.
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?
No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.
You're a fucking great policeman, but give yourself a break. You're here 5 minutes, you find yourself a fucking homicide? .. Not many people could do that in a place like this .. And you gotta admit, there's a lot of shaky areas in this case? .. I mean, stop me if I'm going up the wrong nostril ..
I'm asking it.
Are you sure you didn't call?
Bits.
What d'you mean, "bits."
<u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.
That's a liability, Ross. I don't want you hanging on to my shirt. Anyone but me comes down these stairs, take em out but try and keep him alive. I want this bastard living ..
He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
He says, you freaked one of em out?  "Asking a newly blind kid if he can 'see,' is both cruel, and dangerous" ..
No.
Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
No, it has a mind of its own.
Well, some cars sound fat and some cars sound thin, and this kind of car sounded "hollow" ..
No.
Oh.
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
There's no one "looking at you" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me.
Pray?
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
Why?
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
You do?
I don't want them to arrest you.
C'mon, Chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. I'm not taking notes ..
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.
No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to <u>stop</u> this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing <u>me</u>, & <u>everyone</u> off.
I know about the bachelor party.
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
Well, no you didn't --
It's a plan --  -- _ 51.
Could you just stop moving?
No.
No.
I see what you're saying.
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
Oh come on --
Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
Now what did you lose?
No no, I know --
Absolutely.
Call me later, hon.
And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted.
Mission... statement...
Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.
And I appreciate that impulse.
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
Tell me -- let me help --
I think we made a mistake here.
Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello. _ 130.
Honey, he's engaged.  And for the first time in my professional life, I'm a part of something I believe in.
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
Now you want Arizona dollars.
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
You.
No, I'm saying to be --
Fine.
No tell me. _ 84.
Then you gotta have The Talk.
I'm a little worried --
Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
I'm asking you a question --
Well.  Good luck with that --
A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!
"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
Pleasure.
Let's go the zoo.
You said "fuck".
Funny.
A lot.  We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.
Shut up!!!
A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?
What did you say?
Just drop it Paul!
Eric!
We're not going anywhere, I promise.
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, that’s where he's headed.
Where is it?
then we should...
He loves you too.
I don't remember that on InGen's list.
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
Alan don't be afraid to evolve.
You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.
You should.
I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
Sure you have. You wrote that book...
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
John . . .
You'll need an animal behaviorist, someone with unimpeachable credentials.  I believe you already know Sarah Harding.  She's got theories about parenting and nurturing among hunter/scavengers I bet she'd be dying to prove on a scale like this.  If you convince her to go, it'll be a major coup.  When she publishes, the scientific community must take it seriously.
That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
Kelly!  What are you doing here?
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
Possible.
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
So that others would know about this place?
I don't care about my life.  But if I'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger --
It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-
Maybe.  Maybe not.
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
I believe in him.
Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
None of that matters.  Our communications equipment's been destroyed.  If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --
What now?
How am I supposed to transport them?
I got an eighteen minute window.  Eighteen minutes, and your company catches up on ten years of research.
Six weeks?
These are dilated.  Take a look.
I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?
But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
John, John.  John, you're still building onto that Flea Circus, that illusion.  And now you're adding onto it by what you're doing here.  That's the illusion.
Why?
Okay, I'm following the tubing.  I'm going down a passage way.  How long does this stuff go for?  Could you guys talk a little bit to me?
The taphonomy sure looks that way.
Say again?
We were right!
Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!
Yeah, I know.
- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
The fences are electrified, right?
That's right.  But they never attack the same place twice.  They were testing the fences for weaknesses. Systematically.  They remembered.
It's anti-nature.
Oh, imperfections?
Unpredictability....
- - shut up.
Forty-eight hours from now, I'll be accepting your apologies.  Now get out of the way.  So I can see them!
Sure, they will, they will.  We'll have a - - coupon day or something.
Oh, yeah - - great.
What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.
Tim, I'm right here.  Easy catch.  Easy catch.  Count to Three..
Me?  Oh, hell yes.  Three.  I love 'em.  I love kids.  Anything at all can and does happen.
Why?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Are you two, uh - - are?  I wish you the best luck.
Kids get scared.
For a further three years.
The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex.  I'm going to look after you.  I'm going to help your brother.  I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?
It's safe.
It's safe.
I'll stay awake.
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!
It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
Don't do that!
Thanks, Dad.
We love the presents.
What?
That was great!
Great.
You learn something new every day. Let's go.
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
What about that other guy?
Other guy?
Who's there?
Who?
It's all right.  Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
So?
I thought she was a killer, too. You know... that she chopped up a bunch of teenage camp counselors... before she was decapitated.
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
Oh?
That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
Insomnolesence...
It's a neurological disorder affecting the hypothalamus. The part of the brain that causes sleepiness is inactive. They didn't know about it back in the sixties. Even now, it's not understood very well.
Then I'd say it's bedtime for Jason.
Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
How's that possible?
How long will the effect last?
If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.
You have been hearing the sordid side then.
You were his friend.  One link is all they need.
Just what you've published.
A cenotaph -- a monument to someone whose remains ended up elsewhere. But look --
What an extraordinary request!
A true friend would do it.
No, I left it in his office.
I'll commit that to memory.
You're detestable.
Sit down, Kafka.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
One of you must be mistaken.
Eduard wanted to marry me.
Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
Usually.
This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment.
They're dead now.  We can get help.
There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
I do.  Always.  You understand the world better than any of us, Kafka.  And what it's becoming.  I've always held you in the highest regard.
I don't know.
Was he depressed?
Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party.
It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.
He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
Here too!  They're all in a dreadful muddle!
They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
Does this look like the "Queen Mary"?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!
It's ... lovely.
You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
I not doing this for me, Jack! It's for my father. This is possibly the greatest anthropological discovery of the last two hundred years! It belongs to him! I'm going to that island ... nothing's going to stop me!
No! Don't!
We need those co-ordinates -someone's gotta get back there and jot the rest of it down
Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!
The mountains?
Y'know ... traditional ceremonies where the woman ... divest themselves of their undergarments.
An ape ... some kind of ape.
You better not slow us down, Denham!
Kong ...
Forget it, Denham ... for Godssake
What?
The girl's dead, Driscoll. There's no point continuing on.
She's got a bit of an attitude, that girl. She's turned down a bunch of money. Too bad ... it would've been a great angle - "Beauty and the Beast".  I must be getting old - I thought you two had something going there.
Why?
Can't you see I'm strung out?  Please, we're waiting for it -- he's got to have it!
Well we're pretty --
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
Yes -- all right --
Will you let me go then?
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
-- Tuscarora --
I can't say he was anybody!
I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight.
Can't you get him?
Is there anything more I could --
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --
I don't get you.
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
Is that all you have to say?
Hell there's nothing so mysterious about the square life.
My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start.
Go down in my room.
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
About what?
Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
OK.
That who?
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
What?
I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
I'd like to make something clear. I don't go after a girl; a girl comes to me. Her choice. Right?
Did she talk about him to you?
Town Police.
No.
No.
My daddy doesn't hit me, silly. Why would my daddy hit me?
What if she forgets?
Uh huh...
I'm sorry.
I hate it.
You're no bargain either, pal.
I'm sorry...
That's okay, pal.  Go back to sleep.  It's very late.
Uh huh?
Sure.
Sure.
No.
Uh, uh.  There was no such a thing as Burger King.
Because...Well, that's what he does.  He's a very powerful man.
Who will read me my stories?
Yes, your honor.
And would you describe those years as happy?
Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
Eight, almost nine years.
And did you have a close personal relationship?
A heavy drinker?
No.
Well, I can certainly understand why you left him.
So, you were a failure at the longest, most important relationship in your life.
Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
Fine.
Such as?
Ted, do you love him?
Joanna, what the hell is--
Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.
Hey, Ted.  C'mon in.  I wanna' talk to you.
I don't.  Jim, this isn't anything like what we talked about.  It's not even close.
You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
But it doesn't work that way. A major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969--in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins.
Six.
Charley, my husband, and I are ...divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot.  So, I guess we see each three or four times a week.
Ted, I won't lie to you, we don't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you're out of work.
I don't know.
She's the mother.  That means she's within her legal rights.
No, but--
How many?
Fuck you.  He's my son.  I'm staying with him.
I came home tonight.  We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?!  Do you understand what that means?  It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.
I'm gonna keep him, why?
You're on your own, understand?
Slow down...Slow down...
How many onions does it say to use?
Look,  I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay?  I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.
What?
Uh, huh...
Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?
It is alright, Father.
Can I do anything I want?
But, I am in charge.
Can I free the prisoners?
No!
We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
Yes, but they say he did.
Far, far away.
How many?
Roughly five thousand men.
No. This war is almost over.
I do not know, Holiness.
You are the man who wrote this letter. You are the man who has come back to lead us. You will soon have great responsibilities. You must know what to do.
Ask whatever you will.
Good day.
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
Have a sweet. Made in my home province. The kind my mother used to make.
Yes, I am aware. How has your time in China been?
Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
I am braver.
You cannot.
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
Where is Poland?
We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
How could I ever leave?
You are unharmed?
It happens when I land.
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
Then do it!!
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
I see blood.  Maybe you got him, Hank.
'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
You ready on shore?
Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
You shoot on my order.  If he charges, I'll be yelling "go" which means drivers take off.  And drive fast, they can move on land.  You set?
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
Excuse me?
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
Yeah.  Thanks to you.
The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
And even if they <u>did</u>, I doubt <u>he</u> or <u>she</u> would have problems with <u>tents</u>.
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
Excuse me?
I didn't say it like that.
I'm not mushing it.
Good idea.
He's floating.  Take it home.
He heeds a tourniquet.
Yeah.
Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
You think?
Obviously I was wrong!
<u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.
Don't count on it.  We better take him out.
Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
What is this?
Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.  Could you cut me down?
He said he knew Karate!
I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
A tooth?
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
Why does she keep repeating the name?
What girl?
I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries.
I will... I promise.
Get me out!
Shut UP!  The other officers will be here any minute! you're perfectly safe now!
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill.
You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.
Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?
There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
Point taken.
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
You do until six p.m.
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
Did you ever work with her?
I think so.
Freddie was so happy for me when I got this job. This - toaster giveaways, and Barry Manilow on the speakers all day - she thought this was really hot shit. What did she know, big dummy...
It's much better than your shoes.
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
Then please - do this test for me.
No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
Quid pro quo, Doctor.
The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...
Nobody sent me. I came on my own.
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
No. We just -
All right, then tell me how -
What was it?
I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could...
Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring...  to my blood...  ...than any imagining could possibly have been...
Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
He knew the consequences. And he stayed.  Are those the actions of a criminal?  ...Duncan, do something.
You do not know what you are saying!
What?!
Dark haired...
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
I thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia?
Excuse me...
I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers...
You're not coming with us?
What else?
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
Yes. You may.  You there. What does Munro call you?  The "Scotsman" has sent one of his Indian allies to guide you.
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine and he has more of them. They keep our heads down while his sappers make thirty yards of trench a day. His thirteen inch mortars have a two hundred yard range, so when they're close enough, they'll move them in, lob explosive rounds over our walls and pound us to dust. They look to be three hundred yards out.  Bloody murderers.  You have three days.
Yes, sir.
The decision is final.
Excuse me. What did you say?
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
Heart. Give Magua new heart.
I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not you.
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.
Allow me to consult with my officers.
He did.
Yeah...right...
Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
What dead one on the ship?
Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
Seeing how my stock's doing...
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
It bit me!
Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
It shouldn't be a long delay.
You're damn right I do.  Five years down here and I'll pull in more than 15 topside.  I'm not down here for the fun, I'll tell you that.
The weather's good, I already checked, but I'll be off in a minute.
Ah, it's just old, like me. You don't see the Doc opening me up every time I get a new creak in my joints...I say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. But, 'long as we're here...
I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
Who cares?
I'm on the way to the looney bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.
Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...
'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
Two hundred meters.
The infirmary?...
I'm going to try to remove it.
Well, why haven't they answered our flares?
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
Seven hundred for the pair.
Well, talk.
Well not exactly, no; I got 'em sitting in the car, actually; I thought we might sell them back to the Greek, but I am having a bit of a problem getting hold of him.
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.
I'll think of something, don't worry.
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
Like antiques.
You get the guns?
I don't know what you mean.
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
About twenty minutes.
Is that you, Dean?
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
It just cost me fifty quid to have this done.  If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're mistaken, Kenny.
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.
There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.
Get the sodding gate open now, Plank.
All right, all fucking right, I am coming.  Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.
What do you mean?
He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now.
I'll only be a minute.
Do you want me to draw a picture?
What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
Well, perhaps you can help?
I think you'll find it is in your interest.
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
And that does include the amp?
I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
I'll only be a minute.
It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!
Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.
Er, well, twelve.
We need fertilizer, Winston.
What do you mean?
So?
Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
I can fix cars.
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
You really want to know, sir?
It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.
Because it's a job?
You're dismissed, Private.
From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too.
Yes, Sergeant.
Skinny?
You got a cause of death?
Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
So he could have gone out to the base, hopped the fence, dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack.
Colt Peacemaker.
A .45--
That's not the point.
That's in Maverick County.
Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
So that's him--
Come on in.
I never met her.
My mother said he never asked about--
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
Cliff--
Cliff--
He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
Mikey--
Seriously, I think we should get married.
This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
Pleased to meet you.
I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
Protection?
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
I am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child--
Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P--
That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him.
Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue--
She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.
Forensics people are sure of it. You have any idea who might have put him there?
We got that dedication tomorrow. This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business.
Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
Maybe you're just getting less patient.
Well, you hire illegals--
Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
And that was the last time you saw him?
Could of been. That was white people's business.
I only went for my last two years.
It could have just been a box lunch from the jail.
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
Most people did, yeah.
Yeah.
No--
Yeah.
I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
So what are we gonna do about this?
What was your father's name?
Try a year and a half. He bands her an old snapshot. PILAR looks at it--
If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
You sell much out here?
Who is he?
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
Isn't that French for something?
I told you --
No.  He's just a guy who's got a nose for this shit.  Like you.
It's an illusion.
Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared.  They knew the Puritan was coming home.
Did your husband know Quaid?
No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,
Where do I sign?
I don't know where you'd start.
That's my business. Harry.
Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
Okay.  I'll keep digging.
I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
I told you --
He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?
Nothing you don't want.
Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
It's all right.  It's not hurting...
I... have... to.
Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
It's one in the afternoon.
I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour.  About last night.
Somebody's been smoking in here for months.
Are you a gambling man?
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
I don't think the dead much care.
I like to know why things happen.
And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
I won't say anything.
She has no real grip on reality.
You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.
And you're not?
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
Who is she?
Maybe... I... don't...
Binding you.
Why would I want to?
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
You'll do it?
How long have you been married?
Two years.
Thanks.
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
No.
I see them every morning.
No, I was looking at you.
Yeah? But look at you.
Where'd you grow up?
Yeah, look at that thing.
Thanks.
Do you like massage?
Not all that pasta.
Do you want to talk to  Zoe?
Excuse me?
What?
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.
That's ok, you'll figure it out.
I gotta go to work.
We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
I spaced out.
Well, it's a nice surprise.  Should I hit the "stop" button?
I can't believe Will killed him.
I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
I thought the spare set was in the kitchen drawer.
Peter, are you okay?
Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.
Eight.  That okay?
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
He will.  He has great faith.
I had to.  There was no other way. Their deaths were part of the greatest legacy I could have given you.
What do you mean "don't worry?"
How many weeks are you honey/
Thirteen.  The last time, can you believe it?  This is how he says "Goodbye?"
Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
I don't know.  I do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way.  I don't know if it works the same way in this instance.  I don't even know when it's going to happen.
Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
Not a lot.
It's me.  Put the gun down.  Maya...
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
Get out of here.
We millionaires yet?
And what about you?  What about Peter Kelson?  Where is your moral compass?
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
She told me she killed them.
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
Child, take a bite.
Dad around?
Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game.
How is he?
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
Camille, she'll be fine.
It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
You think I'd go hoarse for a player with no potential?   When I ignore you, that's when you worry.  Go get dressed.
You're cold?
You could make a career by telling me where.
Monica.  You grew up together, right? Quincy's told me about you.
Why not?
Mom's going to hate it.
Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
Mom tell you to do this?
This brother from my college.
And he's fine, girl.
I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
I'll take that as a compliment.
Didn't have to try very hard.
Never let a freshman take your spot.
It's better.  Even though the whole first season my teammates didn't pass to me cause they were mad "The American" was making more money.  I led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way I could touch the damn ball.
Lucky.
Uh huh.
Your Dad play?
Oh.
How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
And?
And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
Fine, Quincy.
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew. If I'm late, I don't suit up.
Least she had time for me.
Stay!
You're what?
So that's it, just forget about us?
I'm alright.  But you can sit.
Figured it was something like that.
Getting there.
You're serious.
Wow.
From basketball.
Then why are you so upset?
What?
So?
What's that, not great?
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
Said he'd be home later.
I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
Sorry.  You okay?
I'm fine.
Didn't we already have this conversation?
You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere.
THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSSINESS. I HAVE BEEN A GOOD WORKER, A GOOD AND LOYAL WORKER FOR YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.
HEY FUCK YOU DON WATCH IT NOW.
You ok?
ooohhhhhh no.
C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --
Shut it.  Shut yer fuckin' mouth.
Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
Oh, she's fine.
Oh that's good.
It's a helluva disease.
It's me.  Claudia.  It's me.
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
Don't sit down.
I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something --
GET OUT.
ok.
That's great, thank you.
You take cream or sugar?
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
Just Jim.
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
...nothing.  I'm sorry...
It's ok.
I've got troubles.
Yes.
Diet Coke.
How much time do we have?
I don't know.
I don't know, Richard, they need to talk it over --
GIVE US YOUR MONEY.
We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
Oh, you're a rapper, huh?  You got a record contract?
Check that ego - come off it - I'm the profit - the proffesor Ima teach you 'bout The Worm, who eventually turned to catch wreck with the neck of a long time oppressor And he's runnin from the devil, but the debt is always gaining And if he's worth being hurt, he's worth bringin' pain in - When the sunshine don't work, the Good Lord bring the rain in.
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
What happend?
Yeah, I'm here, I'm off the elevator, walking down the hall, now --
Well --
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --
-- and lemme tell you this: Samuel Johnson never had his life shit on and taken from him and his money stolen -- who took his life and his money?  His parents? His mommy and daddy?  Make him live this life like this -- "A man of genius" gets shit on as a child and that scars and it hurts and have you ever been hit by lighting? It hurts and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an electrical charge that finds it's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for "ruined but by himself," not if his parents take his friggin' life and his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you don't? well, what --
Solomon: I am in the middle of so much. So much in my life and this is -- If you do this, if you fire me: I Am Fucked. I can't really explain much, but please, please, I've worked here for four years, four years I've given you and I'm, I'm, I mean what?  I'm sorry I was late. I had a car accident.  I accidentaly drove into a seven-eleven. It was not my fault.
Braces.
You don't need braces.
He has Phil right now.
Where is he?
Yeah.
You got it.
Who are you gonna call?
It's ok.
No.
Yeah...So I go to her school for that for grade twelve...and we meet...she was fuckin...like a doll...porcelain doll...and the hips...child bearing hips...y'know that?  So beautiful. But I didn't have sex with anyone, you know?  I was not...I couldn't do anything...always scared, y'know... she was...she had some boyfriends...they liked her y'know...but I didn't like that. I couldn't get over that I wasn't a man, but she was a woman. Y'see?  Y'see I didn't make her feel ok about that....I would say, "How many men you been with?" She told me, I couldn't take it...take that I wasn't a man....because if I hadn't had sex with women...like as many women as she had men...then I was weak...a boy.... But I loved her...you understand? ....well, of course, I wanted to have sex with her...and I did and we were together....we met...age twelve, but then again...age seventeen...something, somethin... I didn't let her forget that I thought she was a bad...a slut.....a slut I would call her and hit her....I hit her for what she did...but we married...Lily and me and we married...but I cheated on her...over and over and over again...because I wanted to be a man and I couldn't let her be a woman...a smart, free person who was something...my mind then, so fuckin' stupid, so fuckin....jesus christ, what would I think...did I think....? ...for what I've done...She's my wife for thirty eight years...I went behind her... over and over...fucking asshole I am that I would go out and fuck and come home and get in her bed and say "I love you..."  This'z Jack's mother. His mother Lily...these two that I had and I lost .... and this is the regret that you make...the regret you make is the something that you take...blah...blah...blah... something, something.....  Gimme a cigarettee?
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
This isn't meant --
In aid of what?
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
What am I doing?
Around here.
She's my mother.
"Go Get 'Em, Honey."
I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?
I'm really sorry.
...just wait...Dad...you want something...can you say...
Quietly, slow down, whoa --
I don't have to answer your questions.
I preffer to stand.
Mischief?  What the fuck you talkin' about, mischief?
I didn't hear anything.
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
What happend to you?
Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
Fuck.  I think I'm gonna throw up, I think.  I haven't thrown up since I was twenty years old.
Slowly or quickly?
I'll answer anything.
Paula.  Ellen.
No one else that I know?
Did you ever touch her?
...I don't know...
I don't know what I've done.
Yeah.  She's sleeping now, I mean --
I'II go....is it...back here?
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
No.
You should get one, I'm serious, you could get a lot of stuff out of this --
No they don't --
No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
I can't.
Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
What does that mean?
Linda --
I have to go.
Hang up the phone.
Hi.
-- what-what-what, ma'am -- I --
I COME IN HERE - YOU DON'T KNOW, YOU DON'T KNOW WHO THE FUCK I AM OR WHAT MY LIFE IS AND YOU HAVE THE FUCKING BALLS, THE <u>INDECENCY</u> TO ASK ME A QUESTION ABOUT MY LIFE --
Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
Do you have that?
-- talk in the car, talk in the car, moves your ass, c'mon --
Should be one-thirty.
Why didn't you answer those questions?
You're two fuckin' days from the record, get through this and I'II do anything for you, you just gotta get through this --
It's not right.
...what...?
This happens....this is something that happens.
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.
If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him and the man who told me.
You bring me the heart of the Jesuit General, and you will have a palace of your own.
Soon enough.  Here we are.
His plight is obvious, isn't it?
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
I have it all worked out.
We must stop him!
What you're asking is impossible!
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
You're a fool!
Everyone back.
You are right.  But it is a trap.
Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.
I heard your playing.
What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
Raoul is everything to me.
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself.
There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
What is that?
I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either.
No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
What is it, d'Artagnan?  Assassins falling from the sky now?
What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
Silence!  I order you!
I will consider it.  Now leave me.
Yes, your Majesty.
He is my brother.
No, Keeper.
... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.
Sometimes the poor do grow hungry. But why would they riot about it?
What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
... Nothing.
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
You mean shut your ass down!
We're all gonna fan out!  C'mon, let's do a sweep of the alleys -
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
Well don't you think that's odd?
What?
Hey what they did on their time was their business, you know?  I just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he is.
That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?
Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.
Did he harm the girl?
That's great Zydowski, you tech guys are really on the ball.  Harding - call the print lab at the FBI, run the prints through their library, see if it's less screwed-up than ours...
Well read this -
He said he was following up some lead.
I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
Yeah...they did.  One girl...
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
I'm going to need a way to get there.
Issue the toilet paper tear as a...
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
How much do you know?
No.
Last two like this we had, you caught.
I am all right.
What's one way?
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
Is there a label on the Jacobi can that says what lab processed it?
Have him peel the top label back.
This is our boy...!
Francis? Where are you?
I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
Oh, God.
Yes?
Three, four hours.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.
Thank you very much.
No. I can help you.
I don't understand.
I don't think I'll tell you.
I don't want to do that,
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
Mmmmh... I love you, too, Will. Good night.
Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
To do what?
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
Blue, then.
Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
I'd like one of your cigarettes, please.
Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.
Is Crawford going with you?
No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
Yeah. That's great. A little time.  I tell you what, buckaroo...  See you around.
You got a deal...
I know... 'Out in the good air...'
What's that?
I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
My name's Will Graham. I...
Oh, Jesus... Come in.  Honey...!
I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
What is he? Afraid to leave you alone with me now?'  He read the Tattler piece, didn't he?
Huh?
I keep getting it for Christmas.
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file.
Why does it feel good?
"No"?  "No" to which part??
I refuse.
Those are my terms.
Oh, you know the Bay Area!  Always foggy!
"Funny"?  I dunno.  But "intriguing"... "mindboggling"... perhaps "headache-inducing"... sure.  Like, that moment, when you both came onstage...
No, I'm not gonna take it.  If I take it I'll break my back.
Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
So who's gonna pay for it?
Oh!
Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
If you want...
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
Then your father's a wimp.
Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???
I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!
Er, yes.  Speaking.
Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity!
He said he's coming back!
I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
Midnight watch.
Five.  Since I've been here.
Honestly.  Morpheus.  He got them all amped up believing in bullshit. I watched each of them take on an agent and I watched each of them die.  Little piece of advice:  you see an agent, you do what we do; run.  Run your ass off.
Just get me outta here.
But what if...?
... Yes.
The Matrix?
Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
And she knows what?  Everything?
Yes.
That I would find the One.
What vase?
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
How do you know that name?
My name is Trinity.
That was a long time ago.
What?
I just thought... you were a guy.
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.
Because you've been down there, Neo. You already know that road.  You know exactly where it ends.
I used to eat there... Really good noodles.
That's different.
No.
She told me...
We can't leave him!
You can't!
I have to.
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
I believe I can bring him back.
The Oracle.
Dozer?
I can't!
Nothing's private...
Well, maybe they do that in Riverdale, but down here we take cash.  Now, you got it or not?
Jewish...
She don't look Jewish.
No.
Not quite...but keep trying.
Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
Wouldn't bother me.
I don't like loading crates.
What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
That's not going to help.
Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
You tell me that in front of these creeps?
Yeah, Teresa, shut up!  We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie.
No you're not...
No.
Nope...
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
Well...
Maybe, who knows.
Anything specific?
Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.
Yeah...just had it delivered...
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
You could say that.
This is a heisted car!
Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.
Quiet please.
Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
You ate?
He's cute.
Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
A name?
Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
Oh, the goddam party --
And that?
Red or white?
Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
You mean this, sir?
Toast?  No...just the butter.
What 'business'?
You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
What an odd pairing.
Then why did you bring it up?
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?
What'd it say?
No no, not you.
I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop --  Instead it was --
Yes.
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
Don't you want to hear the details?
Certainly, Bill.
But who is he?  What are his creden- tials?  What is his relationship to you?
Well, that's very interesting.
None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
Yes.
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
The Board is waiting.
Hey, this is fun.
Confused, huh?  About what?
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
I haven't.
I've got plenty of friends.
I don't mind --
Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
No.
I am.
And you can't tell me who you are.
But there's so much to tell you --
Don't.  That will come later.
It's a saying.
Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --
Thank you.
Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
A 'deal'?
I guess so.
Well...I don't know.
I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
I don't know.
About Susan?
Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
Um -- not right now.
Then I can't help you.
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
I think you heard me, Bill.
You're not taking Susan anywhere. And what the hell does that mean anyway?
Then what is it?
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
You fill the bill, Bill.
I do?  How long will you be staying?
'Yes' is the answer to your question.
I don't!
Try.  Because 'if you haven't tried, you haven't lived'.
What you were talking about.
I'm sorry, I --
Quiet.
I want to have a look around before I take you.
'Take me'...?  Where?
I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
I'm going to stick it out here.  We still have a shot.
Does Drew tell you everything?
...Then don't.
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
Nothing.
It's something.
Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry --
Why?
Did I say something wrong?
Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.
That's it.
You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?
What?
Just two. So far.							  *
Who did this to you?
Where'd you get it?
What the fuck are you doing here?
Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
Who is he? What have you got me into?
So I just take your word?
There are things you know for sure.
Who?
I have this condition -
Get rid of Dodd for me.
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
My boyfriend told me about you.
Who's your boyfriend?
We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
You've read it a hundred times.
I don't remember.
No! Should I?
Why?
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
Natalie who?
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
Your name's Teddy.
His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check		   * your tattoos.							 *
Recruit us to do what?
I got the item.
25% discount on the load.
Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."
I'm a fiend for mojitas.
It goes very fast.
Show me...?
I never do business in Cuba.  And nobody goes to Cuba but me.  And he is not my husband...
She's dead...
Available cash is not an issue for us...
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
Why?
Whenever.  Maybe later, maybe sooner.
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
I'll be on board by noon.
No.
I am not John Wayne.  There is no "S" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.
What'd Neptune tell you?
Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts.
I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...
Something's wrong.
We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.
Nothing.
No.  Havana, Louisiana.  Don't we have a meet?
Chill out Sonny.
There is "undercover."  And there is "Which way is up?"
I would never doubt you.
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
That's right.
I have faith.  In horoscopes and fortune cookies...
Yeah.
He's talking to you, bro.  What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...
You sure?
"Salutations from the south..."
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
What would you do...?
I like the diminished risk.  It frees up capital reserves.  I like working with self-interested businessmen who are competent.  You can predict their behavior....
Of course!  That is why I placed myself here, with you, knowing Yero would pull this crap.
Do we need this...?
Beg pardon, ma'am?
Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half here. Maybe you oughta run on along. But why don't you take this phone number?
Don't guess. Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you I'm heading East.
You sure are a pretty lady.
Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
I ain't sleepy.
For money.
Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
Can he smell the difference, eh?
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
Few dozen cooties won't kill me, don't guess.
You couldn't lift fly specks from a sugar bowl. Can you hold this?
What of?
They gotta be.
I read it.
Sounds like they knew you.
Here I am going to Florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, I gotta pee all over myself.
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
I simply don't have it, Joe.
No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
No. You got it.
Listen!
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
But just...
I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
Something like that. Cigarette?
What's your father do?
Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so.
I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.
Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
How long?
Seven years...
We've been notified that they rejected the sentence...
Section 13?
Where is it?
What?
Max... Your BILLY shirt's on fire...
It's already been cut.
Yeah? Where?
You can't take anything seriously.
Learn what?
If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece?
It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.
Oh Yesil...  Yesil's his name but I...don't know anything... 'bout...Yesil...
There's some weird shit here.
Weird shit...?
New York's finest.
Track bunnies.  Rats.  They're usually around.
Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude.
Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
I'm sorry.  But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.
It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
Depends.  You got a memo?
Go!! Just go!!
We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
I'll be late.
Right.
I know.  But if it was carrying something...there's a chance you could have been exposed.
Your arm, you can't...
Peter...
You the bug lady, right?
No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
But you didn't even taste your cocoa.
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
What are they...?
What's it about?
Nothing.
It's fine.
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
I guess that means it's okay.
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
Show me the way?
You want me to burn my book?
Oh, but Paul!  I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at--  --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return.
I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
No, just the paper will be fine.
I want my pills NOW!
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
Don't be silly. You'll be brilliant. Think of me as your inspiration.
They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
I'm telling you, I can't.
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.
The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
You've been out of your room.
Don't talk to me like that.
But the time is now. Soon others will come.
Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
Now, you see, it's that kind of sarcasm that's given our marriage real spice.
They're hauling Misery into court.
That thing.  Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
Yes.
Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
In the envelope in my pocket.  My right.. jacket..pocket..
On what.
How do you that.
Oh, I am.  Later..
Say no more.  I'm off to grab a drink. Still favor Bellinis?
Sort it all out.
And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
..or hard wired..
I'm not ready!
What if I pay the rent?
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
- this is very disconerting..
Do what?
Well, Senor de l'Arena, there's no reason to disrupt your party any longer.  we have some further concerns about the disposition of your security guards, which you'll receive in our written report by fax in the morning, hard copy to follow.  Shall we?
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
Care to wait a decent interval?
That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
I don't know that they 'pinched' it. Don't even know that they're blokes.
And that's the only reason?
Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice.
Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
He's touched your heart.  You're overwhelmed.  You need to think it over. You'll meet him somewhere in a month.  If You're not out in 48 hours I'm coming in and getting you out.  Give me the ear piece.
'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
Excuse me?
And then what?
No.  After you've lived with <i>Chimera</i> for twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not even...<i>Bellerophon.</i>
Nyah still on the property?
Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-seven seconds.
What's happening here?  You're dead!
Let's not waste time chasing him.  Make him come to us.  Everybodyís got pressure points.  Find out something that's important to him personally and you squeeze.
Good idea.
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
Stay out of this. OR Lachez - moi OR T'agueue
I'm walking.
No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.
What?
Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.
I'm going to answer it.
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
What kind of help?
Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
Whoís dead?
Location green.  One hour.  Iíll be there myself.
Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset.
You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's --
Now I want you to hold onto it.
You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in.
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
Mm - Hmmm...
What about Job?
I wouldnít worry about him.  Once youíve got the money -- heíll find you.
Do you <u>want</u> to blow the fire through the whole building?
No, weíre going to recover the disk, understand?!  Now move!
Why?
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
I thought I'd take some now.
I guess.
We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
You got it.
No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?
I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going.  You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.
The guy died.
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
You're married.
You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other.
I don't know what to advise my son. I think he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don't look ridiculous.
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
Just Johnny.
Stupid yourself.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.
I don't know. I think it's the moon.
It makes you look like an angel.
Oh no I didn't!
I'm in love with you!
What?
What are you talking about?
Alright.
You look beautiful. Your hair...
Thank you.
He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead.  Come on, let's go in.
For what?
I like parts of it, but I don't really get it.
I couldn't believe it! I didn't think she was going to die. I knew she was sick...
He didn't come!
Why?
Let me go home.
No. I'm gonna wait.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.
So we'll pick up the car, we'll make the plane in plenty of time.
Who is he?
Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away.
I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
WHAT?
I must ask for that back.
Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
Pop don't like Johnny.
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
Where you been?
Then you don't know. You're just imagining it. He's too old.
She recovered.
What's the matter with him?
The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!
I... a... slept with my fiancé's brother.
You should think about this.
It's late.
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
I don't know.
Do you have a girlfriend?
I am alone in the world.
She was just too young for you.
What do you do?
Don't shit where you eat.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
He's a plumber.
You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
I knew she had it.
WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!
Does wood sink in water?
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
No one live there.
We are the keepers of the sacred words.  NI ... Peng ... and Neee ... Wom!
Oh!
We want ... a shrubbery!
One that looks nice.
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
What?
You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
I'm invincible!
This is the castle of of my master, Guy de Loimbard.
Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
What?
Oh yes.  It's very nice + +  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER  turns to some others. + +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one. + +  They all giggle. +
My liege,  I am honored.
Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ...  leap out of the rabbit and ...
No!  Not the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
No.  No.  No!
Yes, my liege.  Stand by for attack!!
Oh, just some friends!
A Grail?
Behind the rabbit?
Charge!
... But all the decision of that officer ...
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
Ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone?
I'm getting better!
You're not.   You'll be stone dead in a few minutes.
Do me a favour.
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
What is your quest?
Yes he is.
I'm not quite dead, sir ...
It just seems silly ... me lying here.
What - the curtains?
Father, lad.
You're not going to do a song while I'm here!
Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!
I was saved at the last minute.
No ... just keep him in here.
Until you, or anyone else ...
You are in great peril.
Please ... we are doctors.
I'm sorry, I must go.
I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...
I am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.
You've said it!  Aaaaarghhh! ... We've said it ... Wwe're all saying it.
Did I tell you?  Did you listen to me?  Oh no, no, you knew better didn't you?  No, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it.  The names you called me.  Well, don't say I didn't tell you.
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
Seventy a year.
Sixty.
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
It's only grief makes her like she is.
There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.
You've got three broken ribs, man!
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
It's what the maids are for.
It's cold out there tonight, Barney.
I don't think I've had that pleasure.
Of course.
I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think it's too much that the gentlemen of the house should be dictated to by a servant.
You'll talk when I'm finished!
I'm sorry?
You'll be sent a message.
In matters concerning the Household, I act on her behalf.
Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her.  What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!
Is that the Queen's request?
That can wait till the weekend.
I've been called back to London.  My last day.  I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar.
You're injured.
Surely --
See what?
No love.
But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
You are well?
Yes.  That will be company for you.
Yes, ma'am.
I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
Of course I shall say what I have to say.  I always do.
The Queen forbids it.  I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please.
I will not hear any more about my safety!!  You made me a promise and now you have broken it!
You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
Oh, several things.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
Yes.
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
Who?
Mrs Brown.
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
Excellent!
No, indeed.
Just them?
Has he been hurt?
I believe not, ma'am.  I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink.
No.  I shall be out walking.
I have no idea.
They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
Why is he not here?
Then why are you not with him?
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
Well...it involves a paradox.  You have to trick The Boatman.  Now all the while, you also have to watch your strength.  You can build that back up by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing guys...
Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
What's the question mark?
Maybe he's not dead.
He?
Actually, no.  I was just telling Nick, here, that my t.v.'s busted...
Guess he took off...  You have his keys, right?
How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  It's everywhere.
What are you going to do?
Everything.
You didn't hear me?
No.  If you're smart, you run like hell.
What?
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
We don't have a choice!
Sure.  Never come back.  Disappear forever.
Of course I can.  I can say all sorts of things...
What did you say?
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
There is no problem.
Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
I was afraid of that.
Not really. I met her in junior college and she was from this other town.
I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry.   Are you all right?
I want to play this one close, Bob. Like it was with that girl, what's her name, with the black hair. That felt good. Whaddya think?
Can you tell me what happened?
I don't know who I am.
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
"But you won't..."
"What about you? What will your dad think about you?"
Wally Brown.
Betty Elms.
No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.
Interesting.
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
No...
First Bank ? But how ?
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
Why would he ? His parents are rich.
Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
We drown.
Excuse me ?
Is this really the time ?
But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
There's more to it than trying to see if you'd steal from the company or if you'd lie or cheat.
McCay had a lot money done into researching psychological reactions to questions that are seemingly unrelated, but reveal everything. Like criminal impulses, homicidal impulses.....
I'm in charge of the conversions.  When First Bank buys another smaller bank, I'm in charge of converting them to our systems and way of doing things.
Okay.
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
The Brooklyn Bridge.
So ?
Any priors ? Any police record ?
Checking........
Fire the whole division. We're moving more of the operations division into Manhattan anyway. Whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed. We already have all the key people here. Anyone else is expendable.
We will start work on it now sir.
I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
And how much do we pay you annually ?
I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested "guests".
Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning.  First.... thing...
We have new "guests" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
I don't know.....
I have a turn for the worse for the team !
I can see your small business ! Look at it it's so small.
If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
We just having our first date when you showed up.
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
Where are we ?
Hey buddy. You okay ?
No, I'm writing to the phone company because they keep charging me for calls to Caracas, Venezuela...do you know any know anybody in Caracas, Venezuela?
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
Gee, that is a problem.
I don't think you're very polite.
No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
Can I see him?
Well you should at least try a little bit.
How about a nice glass of milk?
And some taco chips so I can dunk.
She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...
I was pushing as fast as I could.
Maybe he's hungry.
I'd like to, thanks.
Does she?
Do you have any pictures if her?
I know that.
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
I don't know. And I don't care, Kevin's a jerk and I don't like him anymore. He's all yours!
ehh...I don't know I mean....
Well if it isn't Vada, the grasshopper girl.
No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a fascinating life.
WHAT??
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.
What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???
What do you think?
Yeah I guess...sort of.
But we wouldn't really be related right?
No...it was me. And I'm sorry mom, really, ju...just tell me what to do, I'll do anything.
Yeah?
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances.
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his mind right now.
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A gentleman, would choose British racing green, with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a red car, with a black interior and wire wheels, you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is...in front of the children.
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Well, even without anesthesia I always tell my patients to...eh... to relax.
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.
I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
Hey! Oh look.
Do you know him?
This is the street he walks down every day. When he needs inspiration...
Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.
You're such a baby.
You told everybody where you were going, I'm here for the motor home.
My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.
Yes.
Vada you've gotta stop this, there's absolutely nothing wrong with you!
Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
Yes they are.
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
Yeah.
That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.
She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
I wrote that.
Oh, how do you mean?
I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
Are you mad at me?
Did she ever see Vada?
See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
Kiss me.
It's only eight o'clock.
Ya, that rack holds six ties.
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
Dad??
Ahh, maybe next summer.
Soon honey, soon.
In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out.
What are you doing.
He's okay isn't he?
Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.
Thirty five dollars.
What do you get for that?
Come here, sit down over here.
I am.
I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.
Chocolate?
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
I would.
Can I use your bathroom first?
No.
I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
Uh huh, why?
See food!
Where's Daddy?
I'm hemorrhaging.
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
I think it should be outlawed.
I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
Okay, get in to bed.
That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
What's wrong with your eyes?
Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
No, I don't wanna.
Come on, it's fun.
What?
Pacifist!
Bed wetter!
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
Go???
But I have my clothes on!
Sure.
Okay.
I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.
If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note.
I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.
Sure.
Neosporin?
That was Thursday.
He has you on a pedestal.  And me in his arms.
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
Then it could all come out, sooner or later.  Nobody should be in on this.  Just you and me.  Or, more correctly, I.
You don't understand.  I've never felt this way about anybody!
I mean she's a junior at Chicago University, she's twenty years old! Like when I first met you.
She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
She finds him "personable."
I never eat when I'm serene.
Never can tell.
No.  I've got you.
I'll check.  I have it on powerbook, these days.
Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway.  She couldn't have lived with it.  I know that now.
You never want to do that, see, that's always a... costly turnover.  As they say in the sport biz.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
That's little egotistical.
What do you have to buy?
I see.
You have to what?
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
I got them right here.
Bye, Bye.
Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
Minimum.
Okay.
What is a turkey shoot.
I'm fine. Can I go up?
She sure sings nice.
He is just wonderful.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
A guy named Walker. Amazing person. He's developed a huge following.
What year?
Nashville.
Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
I'm not sure. Where?
Hi.
Oh?
Doesn't it have a name?
I know.
Premeditated murder.
High?  Do you ever get high? A walk on the wild side. Ever do dust?
What time?
Might be good for you.
Out.
They're looking all over for you. Do you have a copy of the album.
Oh?
How long have you been together?
What? Oh. A film.
No, we never did that
He ain't really new.
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
Spent time in Arizona. Why?
Peter Finch -- he's English.
Is that good?
It's not bad.
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
Well, back in slave times they had a thing called the underground railroad. And we got a whole fan club out there just waiting to be conductors.  So, you kids out there, keep the faith. Cause Mickey and Mallory will be comin' to your town real soon.
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
You been followin' the news coverage?
She was born without a tongue.
Not good.
We've been waiting to do a follow up episode on you for a long time. And that time has definitely come.  I feel it's apparent to anyone who's hip to what's going on that the prison board has thrown the constitution straight out the fuckin' window. You and Mallory may be killers, but you're not insane. You belong in a prison, not in an asylum. The prison board is blatantly railroading you into a hospital for the sole purpose of turning you into vegetables. Now some people are saying, 'So what?' I am not one of those people. If we avert our eyes while they do this to you, we give them permission to do it again whenever they see fit. Today they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions are dangerous, tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel what I say is dangerous. Where does it all stop?
She doesn't talk?
Not to anybody. She sings.
Aside from the obvious?
Do you miss Mallory?
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
Says who?
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
No.
Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---
I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
Two-thirty. Shhh...
Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.
That sounds great. Look, I don't want any of this to intimidate you. This is not going to be a big deal. This is going to be very easy.  I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You guys get your equipment ready, power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote. Julie come with me.
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
I didn't mean they were assholes. I mean if they're leaving, get 'em outta here.
Hell, you got steady work.
Okay.
I'll smile when it's funny.
Walker and Williams.
Make sure he gets those shots.
Name's Duff.
Looks like you're doin' a good job.
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
No. Just me.  Me an' her.
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
Why did you?
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
What happened, Duff?
What about that girl?
Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!
What about your boy?
How come you keep askin'?
Well, he ain't mine, so skip it.
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
You can have what I've got. It's right there.
Yeah!
What're you going to do?
Nothin. Quit lookin' at me like that!
I don't think that'll happen.
What's so hot 'round town?
Like what?
Like a home, for one thing.
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
Yeah. That's right.
Plannin' on getting married?
'Don't sound so sure.
Didn't I tell you to beat it - huh?
Okay.
I said, she's in great shape.
Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
I guess I ain't.
Don't look like there's a right way.
You'll be in trouble, son.  Now just how do you intend to support your family?
'Oughta give up smoking, Jocko.
Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
Hell, they're all after the same thing.
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
Okay, boy, beat it.
Anything you say, baby.
Sometimes.  And sometimes I don't--  Shut the fuck up!
Nice and slow. You come in. Get a look around.  Then I get my wife.
Don't play with me.
Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
What's he doing to my gear?
Did you trace it?
Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
I don't have a girl.
The girl 3Jane. We need her.
Jah guides us.
Maybe so...
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
What?
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
How long, Dixie?
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
What?
So you're a wire junkie.
Suicide. I just needed to set the record straight.
It sounds like you.
Give me five minutes.
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
So... did you get a look at heaven?
What went down between you and Riviera?
No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.
We've still got to find the mainframe.
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
Petty good.
No biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you.
I'm late for lab.
Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
What about the "Roaring Twenties"… or "The 80's"?
Anita!
Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
A--flack jacket.
Have you been to any parties?
Hey. There.
For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life!
I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre.
Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.
Better than I...
I love the way she writes.
Well, I'm definitely seventeen and  now definitely late--
Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
What?
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
We're very evolved.
Lock.
Just what?
No.
Why not?
I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
<i>                      -- A box? --        Is it steel? --                     Are there locks? -- Is it filled with a pox? --                          A pox! -- How delightful, a pox!</i>
Just out for a while.
Could be all night.  Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown.  Likes prettyboys like you.
He must've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa.  In the shower!  Left bloody footprints all over the...
Shut up, Grady.
Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening.  It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.
Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
No!  I don't know - everything's all mixed up.  What difference does it make?  I'm in trouble here.  I need your help.
Just watch me.  If anything weird happens - like if I start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here, you gotta try to bring me out of it. his me over the head if you have to. Just don't let me leave.
That's okay, I wanted to.
Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
Traumas of a ten-year old.
Fred Krueger.  The guy in her dream who's coming to kill her.  Seems he was a real guy, ten years before who went around kidnapping kids and killing them.
I just got here myself.  Went to the Public Library.  Cut four classes!
What's this?
Well, what am I supposed to do?
I'll get over it.
I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
Why won't you talk to me?
We'll figure it out together.  We'll stay up all night if we have to.  I won't let anything happen to you.
No, Jesse.  This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.
'Morning, honey.
You okay?
Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
I thought I'd wait for you.
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
Jennifer --
Just tonight, please?  I can't handle the nightmare.  Not tonight.  Not after Phillip.
YOU'RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID -- LET'S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME!  KRUEGER!
To old friends.  And your new dreams.
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
Sure.
We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
That was different.
How do we find him, Kristen?
I don't know.
Those are ancient history.
She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors.  In a way.  All severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...
Didn't get much sleep.
Must have opened while I was away at school.
Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
I'm serious.
That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
We're gonna try.
C'mon.  Let's get out of this rain.
The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
No...
Your dreams?
Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
Neil, please --
What are you talking about?
There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do?
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
Right.  Right.  So that's... fairly good.  On the high side... have you tried the nuts?
Yes.  This one though is... very good.
Coffee?
Okay.
You abide by rules like that?
Yes, you did.
Uh-oh.  That's not good.
Why?
Thank you.  I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be.
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
You have a stunt bottom?
What?
You and every person in this country.
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
Damn, I forgot the jam.
Jesus.
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
I only found out you were here yesterday.
Hello.
Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...
You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
The truth is...
And what would you say...
He wouldn't say.
Christ, what is going on in there?
Anna Scott?
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Don't even ask.
In a depressingly asexual way.
Tony -- what do you think?
Yes, I think that one may be.
Of course.  And is he your favourite Italian film director?
It is great, isn't it.  See you tonight. Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy.
How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
The others?
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.
Wouldn't want that...  Okay -- just one more.
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one name's bad enough...
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
Maybe.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
Well, there are.  And we don't need to go anywhere near that far.  My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.
Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers?
Y-y-y-yes...
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
Mister Washington.
Yes... We were discussing Mister Harding's problem with his wife. Now, who will start?  Billy.
Oh, I had them removed.
Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.
Shoot! No wonder you don't care nothin' 'bout showin' your hand.
Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway...
That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
Lend me twenty.
Atta boy, Cheswick!
Let me get on your shoulders.
They went that way.
Does that mean we have to cut him loose?
Me, too...
Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
Lobotomy?
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
I said out!
Who told you that?
Me, too! Me, too!
McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.
I see.
Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?
Doc, what can I tell ya?
No, this is my first trip, Doc.
We'll let you know.
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
Because I quit breathing.
All right!
Gimme those dice. I'll blow this board to pieces. Here we go...  Lebenty leben, count me over eleven, Martini...
Okay. How you doing?
What are they?
Oh, yeah...
Hi.
Big man!
I don't have any.
Yes, ma'am...
Is he in an asylum?
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
I'm sorry, but without a boarding pass we can't let you on the plane.
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
So she can drive through the streets of Rome paging the man of her dreams.
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
Ha un numero di telefono?
What's mezzaluna?
Please, Larry.  I have to hurry.
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
Are you okay?  You want some help?
You are leaving, aren't you?
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
Why are you asking me this?
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
Yeah.
Well, good.  Good for you.
Nice dress.
The Sun Also Rises.  For Whom the Bell Tolls.  The Old Man and the--
No.  Course not.
In that case... no...
No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
I would call it-- unforgivable.
If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.
Just since yesterday.
Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
And more...
You like shrimp?  I like shrimp.
Mommy, this is Faith.
Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
I don't know, Kate.
Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
He fell out.
I don't think he understood what you were saying.  What's the airport number?
So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
What?
But how could he know?  He only just met me.
Hi.  Where've you been?
A little bad luck?
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
And he is living proof.
Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
This is your most lucky day.  My family runs a pension not three blocks from here.
That's exactly what you are.
Right.
We're all desperate for the money, doll.  That's what made this country great.  Back me up on this Candy, am I right?
You used to love it when I called you doll.
He existed.  He was some kid I knew from Little League.  He was a real jerk.  You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
Ten billion to one.
I'm gonna take her home first.
When I was a mere spit of a lad on Ferry Street in Dublin the nuns used to say to me, "Nolan, don't be swallowin' ye words like fishballs. When you got something to say—  —Talk with your mouth wide open," so if I'm loud don't blame me— it's the fault of the nuns!
That's all. Next witness!
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
Let me explain you something, kid. Stooling is when you rat on your friends, on the guys you're with.  When Johnny needs a favor, don't try to figure it out, just do it. Now go ahead, join the congregation.
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
Yeah. Yeah. I get your thought. You know I seen you lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski Street? Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in—
Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
Now you got me! It's a wonder I wasn't punchy by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me with!  They thought they could beat an education into me—I foxed 'em.
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
What?
That's my own flock up there, getting their evening workout. I won plenty of races with 'em.  Listen, you want to see them? Come up on the roof with me and I'll show 'em to you.
I don't know.
That was nice of you.
How do you like it?
It's quite—  –nice.
I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But— I didn't stay in shape— and—  —I had to take a few dives.
A dive? You mean, into the water?
Terry!
But a priest...?
That goes double for me.
I just told the Father.
Edie— it's—
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
That—  —word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
No, I can't let you. I can't, you're—
A question of who rides who.
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
But it's my own brother they're askin' me to finger— and Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins. When I was this high he took me to the ball games... .
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
What did you say?
So help me God!
Not exactly. Just thought I'd sit down and rest my dogs a minute.  You know the next investigation we get into I hope it's got buildings with elevators in them. This one has been nothing but climbing stairs. And when we hit the top ßoor the folks are usually out.
You'll work.
Yeah, yeah, I was awake anyway so I figured—  They got it made. Eat all they want— fly around like crazy— sleep side by side— and raise gobs of squabs.
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
Easy. Easy, boy.
I'll see you on the roof.
Hey, Terry, front and center.
It's good for you. Develops your mind.
Thirty-six— sev— aah I lost the count.
Takin' over this local, you know it took a little doin'. Some pretty tough fellas were in the way. They left me this—  —to remember them by.
Go on, beat it!
Thanks for nothing, you bum.
When we knock off let's have a bit of a party. We'll drink to God and Ireland, its whiskey and its women, to Joey and Edie—  and death to tyrants everywhere... .!
Definitely! Nolan, my boy, you're a walkin' distillery.
I wonder how many Hail Marys the Father'll make me say at confession.  It'll be worth it! The pallet is loaded now. Terry turns and approaches Nolan.
Nolan... .
You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
In there.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
Well, it's probably just the caretaker, and that's exactly who we want to find.  They'll have a telephone.  C'mon.
All right.  Put it on heavy.
Tie them that they may watch.
Ahh, there is yet time.
I understand, Master
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
Then cancel my order.
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
All others were but infinitessimal bits of fluff, compared to <i>her</i>  This one would have <i>died</i> for feathers, furs, and fluff...and so she did!
For what!?!
Live ones where only the dead should be?
You know better than that.
We don't know of anything, Master...
I'm so frightened.
Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
Did you howl off-key at the moon again?
I can't remember doing anything wrong either.
What?!
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
No, thanks.
He called the day he escaped.
Did you know that when you married him?
He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, "Okay."  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.
That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
He ain't the problem, Jack.
I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
You better come see this.
He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
Whatta you wanna do?
I get that feeling, yeah.
But you still think you can get the diamonds fore they do?
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
And who watches your back?
Shit.
All you gotta do is get in.
Listen, Buddy, the shit that's about to go down, you'll be on the phone with your sister for a month.  Let me do this part alone.
You talked to him?
It was an unusual experience.
Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
Sure, Daniel.
Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
Freezing.  But I'm getting warmer.
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
Who was the friend?
I'll need a last known address.
Another C.
That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
You devil, it's mace, huh?  What've you got here, a billy?  Use it on poor unfortunate offenders.
Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
Bleeding on a country road.
Nothing.
Yeah...
None of your business.
That's my dad.
Think I could have them back?
Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
You won't do that.
A girl.
I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
You did?
Well, does it make sense to you?
It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.
Or once.
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
I don't know.
I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
I'll take the shades off.  Just get this fuckin' thing off me.
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
Use your head.  The guys got five million lying around his house, you really think he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it?
You don't take 'em off, I'm gonna throw 'em off the overpass while they're still on your head.
Okay.  How many going out?
Really?
I was just thinking that I could use a guy like you, someone knows how to ask for things the right way.  I'm talkin' about when you're outta here.  I mean, you can't rob banks for ever.
The fish?
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
It works.  You should try it sometime.
How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally "relaxed..."
Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.
A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
Jesus, I don't believe it.
Another one of those days, huh, nothing seems to go right?
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
I'm freezing my ass off.
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk.
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay?  You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want.
Hey, shit, come on.  I say I want this car, man, it's mine.  You go get yourself another one.  I say I'm in on Ripley?  I'm in, with or without <i>your</i> ass.  I say I want you to come along on another job, see if you for real or not, guess what you gonna do?
I <i>was</i>...
You're not my type.
No.
You a lawyer?
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
He's about to.
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
Dad...
Hello?
Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
I told you, he isn't here.
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
Foley's got it.
Red...Strange?
Yes Sir.
Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
You guys know her?!  I gotta have an intro!  Man, I'd like to --
Land of the free...
Danny, you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother... or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's time I made mine.
I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
Fuck you.
Come on!
Six P-40's.
Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
Longer?  It's getting shorter.
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were. Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's why you've come.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
Y-Yes Sir.
We're all going away.
The time has come to strike!  Or to sit and let the Americans cut off our oil and our future.  I know what you whisper to the others, Yamamoto -- that the Americans are strong.  Yet look at their leader.
Peggy Sue!
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
So he started having affairs, and you got depressed.
After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
Look, Carol, maybe Walter's done you a big favor. You always said you wanted to get out of town. Go for it. And be happy, goddamnit, I'm rooting for you.
Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
Charlie, how are you?
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
Charlie. About last nights..
Let's go down to the basement.
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
I'll never give up.
Listen, I don't expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away. But I would do what I can...
She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
Touchy, touchy!
I beg your pardon?
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
It must run in the family.
But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
I'm not going to marry him. I just went out with him once.  I know! Why don't we go to the movies tonight. Just us girls. It'll be fun.
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
Coffee and a donut.
Hey, man, I'm a hip chick.
Is that one of your poems?
I hate chickens.
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
Maddy's party.
You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.
What was?
Dancing with you.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
I	know what a burrito is.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
You look pretty good for a corpse.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
You're giving me the creeps.
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.
You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.
God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?!
Yes... why?
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
I'll be fine, Dad.
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
Is he gonna be okay?
Zowie.
He pissed me off.
I'm not burying him here...
What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
Maybe it takes a while...
In a word, Bob...
I am relaxed.
You're going to the office?!
One hour!
If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
Funny.
It's okay. Can I sit down?
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
Continue.
Makeup.
No. They didn't fire her.
Any settlement agreement <u>must</u> include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work.
I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
Sure. It's fine.
What happens?
Yes.
It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome.  Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on?
Really?
Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug.  Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant.  It's an anti-trust action.
We ought to be suing him.
Charles...
It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
I got the quick-and-ugly version.
As fast as you can.
What, you're afraid?
Like the light is scalding it.
How many bottles?
I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....  Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
What?
Like what?
Like my pistola.
Let's just be sure.
I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.
Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
Which half?
I see. Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --
I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.
Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
Oh, so I'm disposable?
Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
What, it's broken?
Neither do I.
What's so special about him?
And they fell out of the sky with you?
No.
You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
I'm prepared to die.
Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever.  Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid. How does it taste?
So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
Come on. Get me out of here.
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
My name is Taylor.
Stop right there. Bring me that paper.
Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
There! Can you believe it? I looks like he's talking.
Which one?
You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
You want her that much?
She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
God bless you.
He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.
Yeah. Back about 100 metres. He's dead, now get going, the gooks are all over the fuckin' place.
Shit. Get your boots on Martin, next time I catch you putting mosquito repellent on your fuckin' feet I'm gonna courtmartial your nigger ass.
Tricky bitch, reason you gimme dat turkey loaf is nobody else can eat that shit 'cept me so don't start your game playing with me Junior.
Sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there.
Only way you'd get some pussy is your bitch dies and wills it to you - and then maybe.
Fuck this shit! I ain't dyin' in no white man's war! Ise didi-ing this motherfuckah!
...See them go down? Like fuckin' target practice man, fuck you Charlie!! Ho Chi Minh sucks dead dick!... Crawford! 
No!
...don't feel like it either.
Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!
Merle? Jesus!... Patty?
Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
Right...
I think you're a nice girl. I like you. But I can read signs if the print is large enough. It was your manner more than the wedding ring that bothered the inspector.  A sort of tenseness, as if you were afraid of something.

I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
I'm trying very hard to be polite about it.
Would you mind?
How do you do?
How careful should I be?
I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
Crossing the border this time of night they're a bit particular. You'd have to prove your identity, you know... unless you've got a passport. They might even want to know why you're in such a hurry.  Otherwise they might think...
I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
Whatever you say.
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
He could hardly help suspecting you.
Dance? Tonight?
You, too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
I'm different. I like it fine.
Dance? Here?
I didn't notice him.
We'll find out.
All right--following me.
So have I.
There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
I have my own warrant.  Stop a minute, please.
The best interference runner we've got.  He thinks he's in love with you--and he's a gentleman.  Come here, baby.
My father died in jail, and he was twice the man I am.
I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.
Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
You've had dealings with the police before?
Who hasn't--one way or another?
We try to be decent.
Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
Goodbye, Betty.
We know everything.
What are your rates?
Why not here?
Martini.
What's a buzzer?
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
Your concentrating too hard, Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?
How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
Passkey?
You nasty, sardonic--
Sardonic, if you will my dear. Bust nasty. You lied about the gun.
That's not enough.
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
I'll know when I find it.
Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
Where's the shell?
Should be over there.
Do I know who lives down there?
You can find out.
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
Four different people, Inspector. Three men and a women.  I've made slides for two.  They handled both envelopes.
She's the only one who had a dead man in her room.  The only one who won't give an account of herself. The only one who tried to run away. And the only one, so far, I've been told, who went to such lengths to disguise her identity that she even removed the labels from her clothes.  What more do you want?
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
You're a young man.  You're romantic.  You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart.  You'll grow out of that.
Not too far, I hope.
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
We'll see you next week, and if--
These are transcripts of various radio broadcasts, including Gaitskill's, the one they tried to stop.  You ought to have that ...
Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
Look, I'd rather you didn't ask me questions.  I can't talk about it.
A glamorous young lady way above his station...
Hello.
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
Good.
And to history.
That's her.
I think it went on rather too long.
My real father?  Well, he was a flashback.
Yes.  You're much too old to making a drama out of alienation, or whatever you call it.  You've got to take responsibility for your own happiness.  That's what I think anyway.
How nice.
Well, you know...
Yes, if you like.  Call me at work.
In radio we're different.
No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.
Well, you should.
Nonsense.
Let me see.
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
All right.
I'm terribly sorry.  He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back.
'Night.
No.
Not yet.
Thanks for stepping in.
I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
'One shot stopping'... good, very good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win.  I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it.  Check out the weight.
Whoa, whoa!!  Think it through!  I'm the only one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second.
Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.
Guy's the Toxic Avenger.
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
Kid, get outta the way!!
NOOO!!
No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
What are you talking about?
Yeah.  I just want to sit out here for a minute.
Warm them up.
Tyler, put the gun down.
My name's Johnny Utah!
What do you mean?
Who's our back-up on this?
No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course.  We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
Mmmnnn...?
I think it's Hawkins.
I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
Not bad for a man who hasn't slept in four nights.  I'll get used to it.
You're making the right decision, sir.
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
Sure.  For five bucks.
Sit... and spin.
New York.
You like being a hooker, Vivian?
Fine.
Edward... you got it!
What?
You know how to drive a stick?
Uh-huh.
Oooh, thank god.
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
I'd say you give a good dollar value.
What?  Why?
What are assets?
I think you'll approve.
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
Uh-uh.  No work.
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
Fuck off.
What if someone tries to steal it?
Where are you taking me!?
To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
The opera.
When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen.  Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times I had that dream did the knight say, "Come on baby, I'll put you up in a great condo."
I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.
It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
I have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
Why?
Give me twenty minutes.
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
He's not gonna want us.
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
And leave all this?  Not in a million.
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
And who is that?
Of course.  Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
Miss Vivian.
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  Are you a fifty dollar whore?
Then why bother curing me?
I suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. I'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed?
Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
I do not marry tonight.
With pride. What can I do for you?
Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago?
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
It never happened.
Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.
Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
Who's Guilder?
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
Veer left. Left. Left!
Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?
-- wait, just wait --
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war.
I'll say -- how do I find the Count? -- Once I do, how do I find you again? -- Once I find you again, how do we escape? --
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
Nothing comes to mind.
And what is that?
Tell me.
I must know.
No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
You know what a hurry we're in.
There will be no arrangement --  -- and you're killing her!
Good. Then pour the wine.
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
I'm not listening.
Nobody's hearing nothing!
An hour.
Yeah, an hour.
Oooooooops!
I have hurt your feelings.
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
Mr. Bialystock ...
I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
One night.
What scheme?
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
Two pistachios, my good man.
I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
Okay, take it off, take it off.
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
Only if we ask him.
Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
Vat about it?
That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. 
It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you.
I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.
No.  We go. 
Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.
By the sacred memory...
Bismark...
Good.  Good.  Now ve sign the contract.
Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.
Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up?
Send for Goebbels.
No.
No.
No! Of all...
Not at all!
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I just want to make a change and start...
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
All right.
No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.
Okay. If you'll come along...
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
Like what?
I think something's wrong, too, Miss. But not the same thing. I think your private detective is what's wrong.  I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from Norman Bates...  and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.
Just what he told your detective.
Sure...
What's the matter?
Never mind my ego. Let's talk about Mary.
Where... can I stay?
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
Arbogast said...
Well?
Alive.
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
Arbogast! Sam, he liked me... or felt sorry for me... and he was starting to feel the same about you. I heard it when he called... in his voice, a caring. He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us.  Unless he was stopped. And he was stopped, so he must have found out something!
Why not?
We could laze around here a while longer.
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
No.
How can you even think a thing like that!
Don't miss your plane.
No.
Don't worry about it.  But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh?
You'd know, of course.
Only my share.
Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...
Very early. Dawn.
You slept here all night?
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?
Fine.
Just an expression...  What I meant was... I'd do just about anything... to get away.  Wouldn't you?
Mother, please...
Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
That sounds to me very remarkable.
Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats.
Come on, we're wasting time.
I'm losing my blood!
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
You would.
Why didn't you eat last night?
I won't let you say that!
Ralph! Ralph!
I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
How quaint. But I can go any place you can. 
You mean he was colored?
Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
We'll grant that.
Almost certain.
Almost! I'll still bet I'm right, and let you write your own ticket.
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.
Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
Don't worry -- she'll get used to it.
I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
I guess so. But wouldn't it be better for you to wait until the old man's here?
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
That happens to be the truth.
Who'd steal her body?
Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
Is that a fact?
If it is freedom to represent people with limbs that don't match -- cripples -- you have achieved your purpose. Anatomy! Heaven forgive you. You must have studied with a sideshow of freaks!
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
But I have some friends waiting.
Yes.
-- What if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor?  What then?   What did your life mean?  Who did you nurture, Pauly?  Who did you love?
Yes....
I'm heading out of town.
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
Well, I got to see her.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
In what sense were they bad?
He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
Am I hurting you?
I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
How did the rabbits kill him?
He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.
I do, too!
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
Well, yeah.
I don't know.
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
Well, it's not very plain.
Well... maybe...
Walked, in all that heat? It's a wonder she hasn't got sunstroke. I'll phone Daddy and you go get Doll Baby and Waski.
What did you say, Brother?
Let me see!
What are they doing, Doll?
He had his hand on her titty.
So am I.
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
Oh, I heard from her, I got a letter from her, she's fine. But there is some sad news.
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
Please do.
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do.
I'll take him with me downtown.  And you, too, Rose, if you want a ride.
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.
Well, I have a pretty good idea.
What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.
I don't care where the polecat studied.
Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?
I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?
That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
She already told you, she doesn't know.
What did you forget?
Well, I... I hadn't thought about it that much. I was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and...
I'm afraid it's my fault. I made her feel guilty this morning --  Brother, what are you doing up?
You know Dave, his wife used to do dressmaking for you before she died.
Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
Yes, sir.
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
Well, it has buttons.
Yes, sir.
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
Well, it's Billy.
Well, I'll pay you that back sometime, Mr. Hillyer.
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
Oh, it's all right, beats Jew York. But the niggers have took it over, just like every other city we got, only worse.
I don't mean that the way it sounds.  Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when.  Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?
I see. Outside it.
Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?
A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an animal epidemic?
Gonorrhea?
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
Oh, Mother, cut it out.
Yes, Ma'am.
Oh-hh, ohh-hh, Lord, he's gonna kill me.
It'll get better now.
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
Well... what can I do?  You've created a dilemma...  And, look at the that. Time's running out.  I wonder... how can I impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me?
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
Abe Lincoln...
Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  Leave off.  Here's your paper.
I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
We should slow down.
Hands off the suit, monkey-boy. Close your eyes if you're scared.
Clench your teeth so when we land you don't accidentally bite off your tongue.
Name one.
You don't smoke.
What... what kinda thing is that to say?
Oh... okay.
It doesn't say that.
What was I supposed to do?
You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
Nope.
Go wherever you want.  Live how you want.
No.  Don't open your mouth!  You <U>honestly</U> think you can explain this to my satisfaction?
Till the last firework fizzles out tonight, detective, you sit a desk. And, after that, I'll decide if you keep your shield.
You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
You think you accomplished something... like you're heroes? Fuck you!   This is meaningless! You'll never win!  You know, as soon as I'm gone... someone's going to take my place.
All I'm saying is, your little Bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
I can't believe I'm hearing this,
I'm well aware of that.
We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!
I can't do it, Ben.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
As you wish.
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
Oh, no.
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
Yes.
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
Oh don't be so shy.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
You know this earth - this person.
You must leave now Dr Scott while it's still possible.  We are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go now.

No no no no.
And our World will do the Time Warp again.
Shell-shocked!
Do you have a phone?
I think he might be worried.
I'll call your brother.
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
Could ya take off that hat.
No... Sharp -- You look great.
Yeah...
...I can't beat him.
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
Paulie, please --
Why?
Paul.
It's not your house --
You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
You a virgin? -- Ya let 'im in ya pants, didn't ya!  Ya pulled down ya pants an' let him have it, didn't ya!!
No doctor!... I'm feelin' good, bro!
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
I suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green.
No, man, it's very smart.
How 'bout this Big Chuck Smith?
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
...Stay in school an' use your brains, dig -- Be a lawyer, be a doctor, carry a leather briefcase an' forget about sports!! Sports can only make ya grunt an' smell -- Be a thinker not a stinker!!
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
I only wonder if this man has the skill to go past three rounds -- Vegas odds say, 'no.'
There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.
Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
What about for food an' stuff?
Ya still light seventy.
Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
How'd you know?
Paulie's sister.
I'm gonna do somethin with it.
Mr. Balboa --
Rocky, would you be interested in --
...Screw you, yoyo.
Hey --
Maybe I like garbage.
Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker.
...Did ya fight last night?
Ain't they?
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
Here's the card?
Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here? Here, sit down.
Yeah.
Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...
Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock. Ya move like 'im.
Would you keep goin'?
Great, kid, great.
Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes!
Hey --
Look at my hands -- See how the joints are swollen.
Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now.
It don't matter.
He's takin' cheap shots.
Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance.
...Tight.
Whatta you think?
She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.
What break? Huh? What break! Who am I to give breaks! I'm a fighter, you haul meat. You do what you do an' I do what I do best -- that's it -- that's life, man!
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
You don't believe that.  I mean. the guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete fool...  but he'd never kill anyone. I know the guy.
So where is it then?
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.
Is this paper even good?
Bastards put him on notice.
Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
Sounds like singin'.
Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
Not really.  Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
Does it hurt?
It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
Jesus Christ... <u>that</u> was the Judge?
You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
A Toon?  Noooo.
Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
Forget it.
... I'd head for Cucamonga.
Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
Tempt not a desperate man!
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
A challenge, on my life.
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
By my head here come the Capulets.
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
Be not so long to speak I long to die.
That's my good son: but where hast thou been
There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
Farewell.
O, mighty is the powerful grace that lies in plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities: for nought so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give, nor aught so good, but strain'd from that fair use revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: virtue itself turns vice, being misaplied; and vice sometimes by action dignified. Within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power: for this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. Two such empossed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs, grace and rude will; and where the worser is predominant, full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
By and by, I come: -- To cease thy strief, and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send.
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
I have.
Amen
Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Well what shall I swear by?
If my heart's dear love--
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
And so did I.
Well, what was yours?
Here's goodly gear!
Consort? What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance! Zounds, Consort!
Is she a Capulet?
His name is Romeo, and he's a Montague; The only son of your great enemy.
Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.
You know it is.
I thought I did.
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of it."  "Have the girl fuck him."  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
Exactly.  And last night I wanted to be with someone who was just like me.
That we're too stupid to trace his calls.
I'm a patriate.
Do you have the material?
Not so fast.  Who's that?
But you hate each other!
I got this gig through a contractor. And he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money...
So what do we do?
Don't cross me...
You should really let a doctor look at that.
Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
Coordinate what?
Something like that...
I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
Same thing, isn't it?
There is that.
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
Who am I?
We live in a singular world, my friend.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
Yes I do.
Good.  Now take the forceps, and remember, Vincent, what we're doing here is routine.  I've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field.  There are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.  Just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out.
Yes.
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
Right now?
Why are you driving?  You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving?
Because I don't walk away.
You speak French.
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
I know.
Doing well.  This is?
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
The Russian would be easier.
I get the picture.
None of them had any --
I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.
Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
Never heard of it.
Shit, more than that.
I mean -- Earl grabs Booth's arm --
Why?
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
Torch it?!
What's that?
I...I can't do that.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
Well we didn't kill him, he died on his own.
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
Well what are we supposed to do?
Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
What do you mean?  Look.  We can make still make it work.
I'm all ears.
Because someone may have gotten away.
What's that?
Denning was wearing a bug.
It's odd.  I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.
I gotta take some money out, that's what for.
Yeah but I need to take out four hundred dollars and the ATM will only give me three.
I know.
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
I love you too.
That son of a bitch.
Great...
Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.
Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?
I don't know.  My friends...
You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
Why would someone do that?
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
Did you say After Midnight?
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Lingerie...
Anything...specific?
Well I don't know...
Have I seen her?
Shopping here?
Oh.
Take it or leave it.
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
About what?
I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
Forget it.
Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?
And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
Are you hungry?
And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
Yeah.  Figured you could have it.
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
Not in the trunk.
No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?
How'd you know?
You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
I said get on your feet!
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
No.
Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
Shit.  C'mon, get up here and help me out.
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
I have plenty of dates.
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
IT IS CRAZY!
Who?
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.
She's walking back towards the door.
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
Snoopy is about six inches taller than you.  I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a chance.
We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
What about a little king pao chicken?
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.
That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.
Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!
No problem.
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
This money is evidence.
Amen to that, brother.
How do I know I can trust you?
No.  But I'll help you.
Baby Duck?
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
Don't.
Ricky Tan?
This is still Hong Kong.
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
It's the same thing!
You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
The license!  You get it?!
Took off. Yes. They took off.
Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.
Yes, I think so.
No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!
Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.
Oh, I think you like this very much.
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
The Feds?!
I could get promoted right out of here.
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need.
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
His hair... any color.
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
Or a vegetarian?
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
I know.  Tell me something.  Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?
Twice...
Really?
I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?
So?  Is that what you said to her?
No.
Agreed.
You know, there's no...
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
Of what?
Wrenches.  My dad's gonna love that one.
Missed me bad, huh?
Well, they should.  Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again.
And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
This is getting serious.
I'm listening.
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
Yes.
Why?
Lighten up, what?
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
No, you tell her.
No, no.  You're her best friend.
Yeah.
Is there somebody else?
That's good.
It sounds nice.
Nope.  Not even when I was young.
Walter, I'd love to --
We'll stay at the Plaza --
I gotta go.  I'll see you at work.  Walter, you scared me.  Don't ever do that again.
That doesn't make any sense.
When you get back, I'll be gone --
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
No.
Plus he fell in love with a temp.
I know.
I love that dream.
I saw her.  She looked just like this --
I love the symphony.
Okay.
A sense of humor.
Yes.
Any time.
You know.
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
Hello.
The cabinets have to be redone --
Grace heard it.
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just <u>knew</u>.
Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there.
It plays in 50 states.
Dad --
Sure.  Looking good.
They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
Dad, you're not taking this seriously.
I'm starting to notice that.
I know.
Okay.
Victoria? She's okay.
No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
So much the better.
They are singing for me.
It isn't right, she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
You weren't waiting for me.
Hunting.
When?
Maybe not. But there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight --  I heard you ask your wife, "Who's that? His grandfather?"
It's possible. Just negotiate.
Are we talking to a union spokesman?
It's Mama's Saint's Day.
I don't want you hanging around there, hear?
That's it?
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ... 
First rate, ain't it?
How?
Like you?
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
I can't tell you.
I don't want to.
Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back.
Maybe I am dealing with it.
Midnight?
I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?
Why's that?
You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.
Because I don't want to see you end up like Kujo and those other losers.  I thought that maybe if you knew that I didn't use, you might see it in yourself to go clear.
Crank or glass?
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Big Bill.
What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
Soon. I promise.  We'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear.  In the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.
Cut the shit, Flynne.
This chink have a name?
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ...  You're in the bathroom.  You've been shot in the shoulder ...
Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
What?!
Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
What'd you do, piss your pants?
Worse. Much worse.  A teacher.
And you've got wiener breath.
You mean like the Donner Party?
What do you mean?
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
That is so unfair.
Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
Yes, sir.
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
You take account of the wind?
Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
They got squirrels there, too, right?
Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.
Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
Like hell, you did.
I am, but I like imported whiskey. So there I am and I hear the biggest ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a rustlin' right there in front of me. That ole' boy comes right out of the brush, I got a clear shot and he knows he's 'bout to meet his maker. I aim, I got my finger tight on the trigger and then I just smile and say to that ole' coon, go on, now, you get out 'a here.  Then I sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a' that mash whiskey.
I'd love to hear it.
Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources.  Miller Go on.
Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
Sorry, sir.  Division is using everything on wheels to get up to Caen.  How come you guys aren't going?
DASHES across the street.
Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
You know classical music?
Those guns are close.
That's better, but you've still got a long way to go.  Talk to Reiben, he's a natural and works at it, he'll give you some pointers.
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
I've got a line on one.
Uh, Captain...
That's not what we're here for.
You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
Yup, hell of a mission.
No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it.
Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.
Stay at it until you get fire control.  Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.
Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
Huh?
Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
No, sir.
Have it your way, Captain.
Yes, sir.
...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that.
Pardon me?
Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
I'll take the whole set.
I'm sorry. Sam had to do a new crown, we had [?], and Jason had a sore throat.  Your big graduation, and no one was there.
Hey, bad throat, huh J-man?
That's not even a scam.
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
See you.  Bye.  Bye Diane.
Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
I'm sorry.  It's just you're a really nice guy, and we don't want to see you get hurt.
You're an inspiration Lloyd; you should go on the seven hundred club or something.
I've forgotten what I was going to say... okay, okay, I remember. Let him do what he wants.
If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for Lloyd?
Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.
Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss.  It's all working out for you honey, don't you see?  It's all working out, just like we planned.  All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
I love you dad.
Tell me, is it bad news?
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
You're going.
You're not listening to me.
Just finishing up in here.
Honey, it's not what you think.
Honey, about what?
You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...
Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?
Hi.
Look at those eyes.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Yeah?
Me?  Sure I do.
Okay, bye.
She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
No.
Be friends?
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
I don't think I am.
Then why are you shaking?
It was wonderful.
We'll see.
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
Yeah you do.
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
What, I'm sorry I said that.  Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.
Then don't do it.
You do?
What?
One more time would be nice.
Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
No.  You just described every great success story.  Alright, it's alright.
He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?
The truck?
Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
Jim Court... no, this is her father.  I'll take...
How ya doing?  Is she around?
How do you pay for one of those?
Well, we pay for the [?].  That guy didn't want to part with it, a little matter of nine thousand dollars.
Am I going?  Am I going to England?  I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right?  What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy?  There's no way.
She's very successful.
Very talented.
What?
I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.
I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
I'm sorry to hear that.
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
It's bad business.
When?
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
Look it up.
You want to stay on it?  What do you got for me?
What's the matter, everything all right at home?  Mila's okay?
We're losing the war, aren't we.
It kind of looks that way.
I think most people right now have other priorities.
They should be.
Are you losing money?
Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
They're withholding payment.
Well, sure.  So would I.  So would you. I wouldn't worry about it.  We'll get it right one of these days.
No, no, what, what is it?
That doesn't work, sir.
What is it?
Where?
I live here.
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
It’s over, Cotton.
I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
"And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
You freakin?
I think it's out of your control.
No, it's not.
It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
And now, drum roll please...
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
Billy had alibis too.
He filmed his victims.
There's nothing. I'm coming down.
It's a copycat killer I knew this would happen. That fucking movie.
Stay away from the cop.
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
No, wait...
I'm sorry.
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
It's good to see you involved.
Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
I have to watch rehearsal.
Is Sid in therapy?
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry?
What's your favorite scary movie?
Now.
You gotta go with it. Scary movies are great foreplay.
Where you going?
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
Me, too. Randy. Me too.
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
No, the other one. The one who played his wife.
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
Please, call me Gale.
Yeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in your book that Sidney got it wrong before. She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother, and he was sent away for it!  Maybe there is a third killer.  Sidney Might know something
He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
Did you request this case?
Hmm.
What did you know about your mother?
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
What?
What about me?
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
Off the record.
Fuck!
Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
When we did the first 'Stab" I realized I'd known Maureen Prescott before, I mean as Rina. I couldn't tell anyone.  Can you imagine the press?
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
Oh shit it's my cell!
No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth?
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
Page 22, Candy's big moment.
I'm hanging up right now.
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.
You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
No one's saying you did.
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days -- you gotta have a sequel.
Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
We're gonna have to keep you, Billy. The governor's got SBI, FBI, and god knows who else on their way down here.
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
Oh it did?
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
What?
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
You don't still think it was me?
I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.
You're making popcorn?
Just some scary movie.
Do you like scary movies?
No.
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
Why are you doing this?
Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters.
Afraid not.
Answer the question and I will.
What?
Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here?
Yes, you doofus.
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
Jesus! The camera-hurry!
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
For attention. The girl has some serious issues.
Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
What's your favorite scary movie?
She's the Scream Queen.
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
Which is you...
So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition.
What happened?
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
Whatever. Just hurry.
It's alright. I'll get it.
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
No way.
Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.
Go start picking up the pieces.  We'll shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner.
He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.
You're wound too tight, Mills.  Let it go.
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
There was a second.
What are you talking about?
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
Yeah, that's true.
Where was the girl?
It doesn't matter who I am.  Who I am means absolutely nothing.  You need to turn left here... at the traffic light.
You'll see.
You know that's not true.
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
Murderers?
You should be thanking me.
Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile.  After that, we'll...
It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
Not here.
Drop it.
Is there any blood in it?
Guessing at this point is useless.
Tonight.
What about them?
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
No.
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.
Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
Saint Thomas Aquinas.  He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
I'm fine.
Think it through.  If we leave a hole like this, we'll never prosecute.  He'll walk.  We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door.
Looking around... I've got a bad feeling these murders are his life's work.
You do your job...
Where's the victory?
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction.  If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations.  No human being could do these things, right? But, this is not the devil.  It's just a man.
You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
One of two things will happen.  We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.
I don't know why... why now?
I'm sorry, I only...
How should I know?
I ain't wearing no gun.
Dunno...Seems so.
You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
Came here for a wedding, Ethan... Until that's over, I reckon 'reverend' will do...
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
Yes, sir...
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
That'll be the day...  'As we developed the village'... Next time you develop a village, hit it where the fightin' men are... You won't get any headlines for killin' squaws.
No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
She's alive...Better she's alive and livin' with Comanches than her brains bashed out...
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
I am...I am...It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls...And if the girls are...dead...Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!
I've seen her...and she's alive.
Shush!...Time for bed anyway...  Likely these'll need some takin' in...Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and...
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
You crazy?
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
Sorry...  Keep the column moving!..Close ranks there!
It still worked in town.
Do you have a better idea?
My father was a pilot.  And do I know how to fly?
If we stand a chance at all, it's only by sticking together.
Yeah... I have to go to town.
Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
In the village.  Look what I found.
Excuse us.  But do stop by for a visit sometime!  You are welcome anytime.
He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she was this high. Wouldn't deceive a child.
You have the last act?
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
And yet you tell me you lie with women?
A goodly length in times past, but lately
Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
Take his feet out. Where will you get
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.  The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
We are about to embark on a great voyage.
You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go
I don't know, it's a mystery.
What do we do now?
How goes it, Will?
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.  Yes, I know.
What is the story?
Ethel.
His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio.
It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master.
But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players.
A comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of Romeo to be the very same Capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his Montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the Pirate King!
I like her.
I'll be damned if you are!
I am.
Oh
Oh, but it is mine too!
In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.
You never spoke so well of him.
"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."
But why me?
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
My hat?
Where did you learn how to do that?
He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet?
And break her heart and mine?
I … Her letter came to me by the nurse.
What of her bosom?
Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
What?
Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
Can I show you something?
Come on, David.
Juliet?
Is that going to be deep enough?
How much?
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I beg your pardon?
Except the money.
So I gathered.
Where will we go? Where will we go? Juliet?
I don't know anything about it.
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
Yes.
Yes.
Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
Just serve.
For the flat.
He even signs them, in his own name, can you believe it? I'd sign someone else's name. I'd sign his name. If I wrote them, that is. Which I don't.
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
-- which is a hack.
You see, they don't really know me.
So I gathered.
Maybe he didn't like us.
Open it.
I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think?
I'm just looking.
Don't look?
And now you tell me.
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
Where he can't get it?
No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up.
Alex.
Yeah, well, that's what she said. Interesting. That's why you're here, you see.
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
No, nothing, sorry.
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
I'm sorry.
That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.
Sorry?
Here.
Right here?
But they sneer, don't they?
Yes, sir.
That guy, the one that died.
What's it about?
Writing seems easy.
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
You know about it?
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
Chicken salad.
No.
That kid... the hairdresser.
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
No, doll, I listen to you. And if a deal loses money that's not so bad either if it's handled right.
That's okay too.
I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
Nummers.
Why don't you see Lester?
What about?
I don't know. Just a minute...
That's great. You look great, baby, great. Dennis, look at Felicia's hair.
No, baby... I'm glad you're coming tonight.
No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
No.
No. You know too many sick ladies.
Yeah.
Yeah.
See if you've been making it with my mother.
She is.
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
I've got heads here, Norman.
Oh fuck, Norman!
Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying.
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
You are today.
Great. Who's been doing your hair?
-- Yeah... your car down here?
Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic?
He's a director.
You don't do that anymore, do you?
Fuckin' A --
You don't think so? I do.
-- mmm --
Mmmm --
-- ass and legs --
I can't imagine being with Jill when she's fifty years old. I can't imagine not being with you.
Why?
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
I can't just let him stand by the door...
Don't leave me...
I don't know -- I've got to.
-- Right after I sprayed her?
What?
-- oh -- sweetheart...
-- how did you get here?
What?
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
Keep moving --
Now, George --
Right now -- I'm at the epitome of my life. Right now I feel so good I'm afraid something's gonna happen.
Do you really mean that?
We live together now.
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
Egypt.
They didn't offer you the job yet.
When I get off work.
-- go ahead.
-- well aren't you --
Where did this come from?
George, now cut this out.
Yes, yes, I did.
No?
I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.
I didn't say it, she did. How'd you happen to get in that line of work?
Thank you.
So I'm going to want a little more of your thinking on the subject.
That, and... I'll be done in a minute.
... this doing hair it's...
I don't know what to...
See she doesn't drink too much.
Well yeah, otherwise it just sort, you know, lies there -- layer so it kind of fluffs out --
I'm not anti-Establishment.
What, do you think I planned it?
Me!
I'll call you back.
I'll call you back.
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.
What was it, somebody's daughter?
Yes.
Steve?
Whatever his name is, that actor.
Of course not.
Jackie, what're you doing?
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
-- Yesss?
-- He reached up and tore them.
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
My God, did I say that? I don't believe it.
-- oh I don't know --
-- he'll never know the difference.
-- there's not much room --
Thank you.
Everybody but us.
I'm not supposed to.
Is Tony the one that tells you things?
What about Room 237?
Yeah.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
Are you having a bad dream?
No.
Why not?
Because he hides.
To my stomach.
Oh, they're somewhere around.  I'm not quite sure at the moment, sir.
A nigger.
Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,
I'm a Wendy.
I did?
I hope it's nothing serious.
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
Yeah.
It's about eleven thirty.
I guess we've been staying up too late.
Of course you are.
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
Stay away...!
Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you.  You didn't let me finish my sentence.  I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!'  I'm going to bash them right the fuck in.
Stop swinging the bat.
I'm gonna go now.
Oh, well - come on in Jack.
Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.
Oh, it sure would be
How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?
I'm intrigued.
I don't suppose they eh told you anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970?
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
Hi.
Stop it!
Let me help you up.
That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
Yeah, I know. It's great!
I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
You want to know what I think?
It could have been anything, Marty.
Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.
What you say?
And I'm tearful!
You know it.
You can handle this.
Who?  The other woman.  Your wife.
Yes, Betty?
What is it, Betty?
WISH HE WAS MINE.  THAT HANDSOME BOY OVER THERE, THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR.
Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
I love my heddles.  Show me again.
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
So use it.  When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration.  Most music is.  So don't hold back.  Let all that joy go right into your voice.  Make me happy.  Let me hear it.  Perk out.  Perk down.
And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse.  And so you truly need our prayers.
Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular.  I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.
Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
Right.  Okay.  Bob.  Nice to know you.
A novice.
Reverend Mother says you need experience, right, in life.  In order to make a responsible decision.  This is going to be very painful for me.  You know how much I love this little room. This whole convent.  Wait.
Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?
This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything.  I mean, nothing really happened.  We just... took a walk.
Keep moving!
The reason?
What?
Useless distractions.
I got it.
Mary Clarence!
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
You have, I believe, some minimal background in music.  Therefore, you are to join our choir.
The choir, Mary Clarence.  Go for the gold.
Out of the question.
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
You saved my life.
Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.
Don't push it.
Think again!  And get out of here.
Screw you!
Then-you run.
Safest place in the world.  You think Vince would look for you here?
Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
You're not... seeing anybody?
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
Even nuns have to pee.
That depends.  Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
Yeah, like what?
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
Really.
It's a bluff, Vince.
It didn't work, Vince.
Where is she?
But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
She wasn't a nun?
And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...
I know. 
Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
I say... if the Horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people, he's solid enough to feel this...
What is that?
Bring Young Masbath here.
I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
Does that look like an animal hanging?
They need guidance.
Master Hardenbrook...
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
Chosen me?
More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please.
It's not something people speak of openly.  She did not remarry.
And now Jonathan Masbath.
You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
Did your father take a loan?
Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.
The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
He has proposed to me twice.
There is no such thing as magic.
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
It was you there?
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
His horse.
No.  She has gone out.
It is fine.  Now, I must...
Yes.  Here...
You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him.
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
Can I see him?
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.
Don't tell me what to do.
Don't tell me what to do.
No sir's right. I'm talkin' to your mama. This is your mama's decision, not yours. I'm lettin' it go on because she asked me, not you.  Now is this the kind of retard that drools and rubs shit in his hair and all that, 'cause I have trouble eatin' around that kind of thing. Just like I am about antique furniture and midgets. I can't so much as drink a glass of water around a midget or a piece of antique furniture. Same thing with a droolin' retard.
You might want to find out. He might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
Childers.
You shut up you, fuckin' retard. Get your shit and get out of here.  That was a wake-up slap, Frank. Remember. Reality, like I said. Don't forget any bit of what I said to you and we'll be fine.
I aim to kill you with it.
Childers.
Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
How come you're carryin' them around with you.
Don't you live somewhere?
They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.
I reckon I feel all right.
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
She says it's for the times when he's good to her. She's lonely since daddy died. She said sometimes she don't know why.  He threatened to kill her if she ever left him. My daddy would kill him if he was here and somebody was mean to mama. Vaughan, he's real good to mama. Vaughan that you met. But he's not able to do anything to Doyle, he's funny you know. Not funny ha, ha, funny queer. He likes to go with men instead of women. That makes him not to be able to fight too good. He sure is nice though. He's from St. Louis. People who are queer can get along better in a big town. He got transferred here to work. But mama said the real reason he left is 'cause his daddy hated him. For bein' the way he is. I wish he liked to go with women. I'd rather him be mama's boyfriend than Doyle.
I thought they was.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
They ort to. You're a good boy.
Yeah.
Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
Yeah.
We're liable to win if we keep this up. For somebody like you, you sure run fast.
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
Yes sir.
You know I would. Whatever you want.
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
I reckon.
Tolerable, I reckon.
I didn't aim to.
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
Yes ma'am.
We sure like havin' you.
Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
How long have you been standing here?
Before that I was thinkin' it'd be good if I could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry.
I ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em. I can't understand a lot of what I try to read. My mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when I try to read.
I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
Can I help you, sir?
What about me?
Do you smell shit?
Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.
Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.
I knew he slept in a toolshed.
Signs?
Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
And what are you, his chaperone?
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
Huh?
What's the difference?
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
Thanks. I knew you'd understand.
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
It's yours?
A photographer ...
It can be arranged. Seeing as how I've read your books. I don't see why I shouldn't share my pictures with you.  It would be an honor.
What do you mean?
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
No, he's not. You are.
No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
Hi, Auggie.
Okay.  So this is the story of how it happened.  Okay.  It was the summer of 'seventy-six, back when I first started working for Vinnie. The summer of the bicentennial.  A kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store. He's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. It was crowded around the counter just then, so I didn't see him at first....
Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.
Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
No, bully for you.
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
It's all yours, baby.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella?
Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.
Okay, Auggie, I got it. You don't have to yell.
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
Thanks for the tip.
I just want to know where he is.
That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.
And his parents?
His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
Those are pretty hostile words.
It'll cost you five bucks.
Not a one.
That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
Hi there, little brother.
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
They didn't have to do a thing, that's all I'm saying. The team was good, the best fucking team in baseball. But then they had to screw it up.  They traded their birthright for a mess of porridge.  A mess of porridge.
So what's the time?
Well, if you put it that way...
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
The what?
Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either.
I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
Is your father an artist?
You'll find juice and eggs and milk in the refrigerator. Cereal in the cupboard. Coffee on the stove. Take whatever you want. But it's time for me to get started in here.
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
No way.
Yeah, I picked it up.
And started to run.
I'm not going to do it.
If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 
And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
Just showed up at my door, big as life and twice as mean.  Wanted to talk to my son.
Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
It is.
Now, how is Miyamoto gonna know in <u>advance</u>?  That Carl loses two batteries.  Must happen once ever' 20 years or so.
Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
And then, something did.  Carl Heine was found dead.  With his head crushed.
I said.  No further questions.
These are fishermen, Alvin.  They don't talk at all to each other and less to me.  Specially gossip.
Pretty darn clear.
And why.  Is that?
Objection!  Speculation.
My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
Oh, yes.
Like you couldn't believe.
That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
He said he didn't want that life no more.  He'd been saving to buy a farm.  He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place.
But even <u>after</u> you had an attorney.  You still claimed to know <u>nothing</u>.  Claimed <u>not</u> to have seen Carl. Am I correct?
You mean, this morning.  The new story, the battery story. That one is the truth?  That's a question, sir.
Yes.
Well.  It shows the prosecutor was wrong.  It was <u>Carl's</u> boat that was dead in the water.  Or he'd never have put up the lantern.
Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
Sure you did.  Help me with this hold cover, willya?
You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
Does it now?
A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
And her farmhouse...?
Well...
For the third time, yes.
He had no reason to.
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
Because I'm working the night shift - and I got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there's a lull -
Wanna see my driver's license?
Thank you ever so.
A what?
Hey, she's ticklish!
Hey, Joe!
Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
Look, stupid, he's ten to one.  Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!
It's twelve bucks.  We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.
This time I'm not going to let you talk me into something that...
They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -
This happens to me all the time in public.
No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
He's going to be ashore with you.
You can both go take a flying jump.
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
Get it while you're young.  And you better fix your lips.  You want to look nice for Osgood, don't you?
Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.
What do you think you're doing?
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.
Stay as long as you'd like.
Interesting.
Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.
And your head is hot.
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
When?
Thank you, Daphne.
A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
I met one of them.
What's the big idea?
You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.
You don't say.
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
Why?
This is where I get off.
I'll throw up!
Flower girl.
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
I don't care.
We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
You won't breathe nothing' - not even air.
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
The instruments are right, but you are not.  I want to speak to Mr. Morris.
Afford it?
That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
You are?
That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
Up, up, up.
- and always the same Four Hundred.
You don't say!
Love it.  Which way?
Yes - now let's see - where do you suppose the steward set it up?
Of course.  On Thursdays, they always serve me in the small salon.
Oh - a member of the herring family.
What's on Thursdays?
You mean - like frigid?
Have you tried?
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
Look, it's terribly sweet of you to want to help out - but it's no use.  I think the light switch is over there -  - and that's the radio.  It's like taking somebody to a concert when he's tone deaf.
It's like smoking without inhaling.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Did you have a nice time?
Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
Show the gentleman to the chapel - pew number three.
Who's going to raid a funeral?
We got different information.
Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
I sleep with my spats on.
If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
You don't owe me no nothing.
Oh, I wouldn't say that.  You were nice enough to recommend my mortuary to some of your friends...
I’m fine. I promise.
To make sure you’re okay.
I’m not as square as my daughter thinks.
So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
Mom, please.
There’s something about him that’s just a bit odd.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
But, somehow, it was Kat’s arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
That’s when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
Lasik surgeon, actually.
No, tell me.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
So, what’s your point?
Right. Seven.  Christ, that’s a long time, isn’t it?
Brilliant.
Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
This happened to you?
We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
What?
I wasn’t saving you from him. I was saving you from yourself.
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
You want me to let him in?
Let me see it...
That does it...
He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.
Yes, mam...
:His visit with his father at the County Jail house --
NO! N-O, NO!
Charlie, you have no legal right not to let this boy know where his father is! You hear that, you and this whole damn court house; what you are doing is wrong!
It was too dark, Daddy.
We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
The rains started to come, and the prisoners were scared to run 'cause they had to wait for guards to round us up, and tell us when to move -- but we didn't mind the rain comin' 'cause it meant we would git a little rest -- we just stood there, watchin' the guards and they weapons get wet, and that made us all feel kinda good for a minute. I was laughin' all over inside -- a minute, that's all, but what a minute it was!
Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...
Yes, ma'am...?
That's right!
Listen, Mama...
Did you find your father?
He won't go mad -- he's just lookin' for a cooler spot.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright! 
Don't mention this to anyone! You hear me, David!
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
I'll walk...
And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
The season is a long way off, Mr. Howard, and by that time, Nathan oughta be home. If he ain't, believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops. We have to because we owe you all that money -- Mr. Howard.
The boy is hungry, Rebecca.
Mornin'...
Ike, you could make a song outta that!
Yeah. I feel real up to it right now. Come on, David Lee, you and me'll do the loading.
I just got out here!
It's lunchtime, and I wanna have a talk with you, Nathan Lee. Come on, children...
But, Nathan--
Is that a blessing, Reverend?
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
I am the clitoris.
Now go, your friends are in danger... The USO show is a mile east of here, just over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
Fragile?
Chef, do you know anything about women?
Very funny!
Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!
I saw him last night!
Sheet!
Oh.
'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
And she's getting worse...
No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy?  I don't think Kenny is dead.
Mph mm!
I am not a prickfuck, mkay? You little asshole!
Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone licks your ass for-
No, what does that mean, find the clitoris?
Be quiet, Ike! The movie's starting!
Fallen one... We have such sights to show you!
Oh, you want out of hell, huh?
Okay.
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
Yeah, they suck.
Isn't that in Arizona or something?
I agree! The only way to save our future is to unite and fight!  <b>Something must be done! We must take action fast! My parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past!</b>
No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!!  I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
What is Terrance and Phillip?
Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
Alright, I'll make the call...
And you call yourself a Canadian!  I told you we should of done Leno!
Don't believe the hype!!
You did? Just now?
You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!
Hey, relax guy!
Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
Yup.
Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?
Really? Where the hell do you keep it? It's huge.
We're going to die here like baby mice who have had no milk in days.  Dry up into crunchy little pinkies.
Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
Oh Sara...
Oh, thank you.
Very professional of you.
Hello second mate Barnes. I was instructed to come to the bridge.
They are awaiting further information.
It's a little late for you to be up.
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
Ok, I will.  The bad news is the ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
Will you transmit the distress signal?
I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
I know, I know.
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
Why can't we?
Close every door behind you!
Even if we do, it might be too late.
At this point I'm ready for anything.
There's only room on that pod for seven.  That's you and the others.  I'm counting on you to get them out of there.
But how are you going to escape?
Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
How does the distress signal look?
No, just enjoying the view.
That is one of my priorities.
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
Nope.
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
When you get a chance.
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
Pinhead! Don't just blurt it right out.
No kiddin'.
Sure, Sid.
I've never had orange whips, I'm from Akron.
Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.
I ain't nobody's father!
You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
You wish!
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
SHEILA!
If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen. 
I want you two to pick up Buzz and bring him to lane six. Junior will take it from there.
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
How Mr. Kastle?
I'm a bowler.
He's my father, Millie.
Coming right up.
No. Not at the present.
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
Sheila, please.
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
So why do you stay?
If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
Nope, I couldn't care less.
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
I can't tell you, Theo.
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
We would have sooner or later.
Did you - kill him?
Can I come with you?
I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
At least I'll die smiling.
You're really pissing me off.
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.
I'm looking for somebody.
If you wanna do business in this town, there's other people around here got more weight than old Faz.
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
I'm the next of kin. I should've seen him.
Wait a minute --
Two and a half days?
But you've tested it?
What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
That's our reserve air.
They didn't tell me anything.
What?
Hold on --
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
Just worry about yourself.
He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?
Working on it now, sir.
I did.
Yes, Harry.
Please watch your closest monitor...
What's the message?
He understands me fine.
If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
What is it?
A foot and a half thick?  That'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation.
What do you make of this?
Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know?  See this red here.
We're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he can't just walk outside!
Internal power.
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
Underwater?
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
Beth --
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
So what?
Where did you get this?
You told him about me?
Beth --
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
Fixing it.
It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
What?
Which I told Barnes was attacking --
Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.
Sintag.
Bingo.
"... and may also cause bizarre halucinations".
Antibiotic.
It's like a sleeping pill?
Three to six hours.
Doesn't say.
Look, it's either him or us, Norman. Another attack, and we go down with this place.
For what?
Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
No, he can't.
You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.
No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
It's either this... or I kill you.
From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
I'm fine.
Not a clue.
You remember opening the door?
Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
But why would she -- ?
I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
Her legs are in the way.
Nine hundred feet to surface.
Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
You mean forget?
A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Impotent?  I'm not impotent.
Beth and Harry?
Captain who?
You mean they haven't told you yet?
Geologists?  At a plane crash?
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
I don't see anything.
In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
They never used to send a Navy car.
All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess!  What happened?
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
What do you mean?
It means you'd better get some rest. We'll be leaving for Mos Eisley first thing in the morning.  The trip will be difficult and dangerous, but it's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to Organa Major.  Now go on!
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
He's bluffing...
Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
You mean we should go after her!...
You look great!  The uniform and everything!
I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.
We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.
Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
Several, I think.  There is not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...
Well, I don't know what to do now. We'll just have to head inland and see if we can't find a settlement.
What an honor...
It's what I deserve.
He was our teacher... He was great.
Not enough, I guess.
Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death.
Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it ? We thought there might be a brain on P.
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
A funeral.
I don't know, Zander.
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Why not ?
What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
Hut... hut !
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
You're the best.
Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
Looks like rain.
This time of the year...?
I won't quit !
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
Keep trying, Sergeant.
AAAAAAAAAAA !
Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
Uh, no.
Hi, mom.
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.
Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
KIRK UNIT! DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION!
V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
I'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise.
Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
It's taken control of the computer...!
Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.
Decker....!
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
Aye, sir.
Thrusters ahead, one third.
Thrusters at station keeping...
See that it is.  Take me over, please.
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
Yes, Captain, a child: evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing.
The point... 
Why aren't you on board?
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
Engineer, we need Warp speed now!
I have one, but they lost it.
You quit.
I just got kicked off my first movie.
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
That's true.  You grow up here?
Yes...
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
Goodbye.
No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
<u>Yes</u>...
No, I don't...
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
Better idea...
Would you go in...
You have to sign for it.
Oh, God...
Read the card.
The other side.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
I do if you do.
Sure did.
She <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. Was her...
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
I'm going to tell the truth.
We did...?
I have to tell you something...
I wasn't doing business.
Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?
I'm sorry.
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
Ain't got no courthouse.  Courthouse burnt down, 1960.
Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
Wat...
Uh, <u>look</u>....
Whyn't you learn your lines?
I loved it...he...
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
Tell it with...
What...
Everybody needs a hobby.  Okay, look Page...
Well.  What seems to be the...?
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
We know that you weren't.
Claire, Bob Bar...
How can I thank you?  How can I repay you for this part?  It's a...what a, thank you for this part.  The first scene at the Old Mill...
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
Yeah.
Is...Is the Movie!
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
And you know what...?
We, we have to give it.
...and my heart goes out to you, because I know...
I, uh...  I've always thought so...  Well, you just get an idea, and try to find the best way to express it in pictorial form.  I've written a letter to the studio and to SAG protesting...  Bill: get a copy of that letter...!  I just wanted to tell you that I am <u>past</u> chagrined, I'm <u>mortified</u> at the way you were spoken to...
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
That isn't very nice.
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
-- she's got 'religion.'
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
Main Street.
What is the...?
What?
It burnt down.
I don't know what she's bitching about, she's flashed her tits in the last five movies...she'd bare her breasts to do a <u>voice</u> over.
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
I don't drink.
Get a typist.  Gettim a typist.  Get outta here.
He's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...?  Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...!
To the contrary.  I want you to tell the truth.  The truth is, you can't tell me, to a certainty, that you saw the thing.  You don't remember, a gun to your head, which glasses you have on.  And you have a fertile imagination.  Imagination wants to fill in the blanks.  Now.  If you aren't <u>sure</u>, then they have nothing.  Bob walks free.  As he should.  Joe:  wasn't long ago they buried actors at the crossroads with a stake through their heart.  You know?  The people who are talking to you about the way we live though we may praise them, we fear them. And they fear us.  Because we tell the truth.  About our lives.  Now, this is a damn roust, and everyone knows it; the guy is looking for a case, he wants to make a name for himself.  If we let him do that, if we let him do that, then we're being false to our community...to our community, you understand...?  To our world.  Cause you are a part of that world, now.  You have to take off the Steel Rolex and put on the Gold Rolex.  And be part of your world.  I got a five picture deal with the studio.  And you stick with me.  You write one, two more, you stick with me, and you'll <u>direct</u> the third one.  You are a part of this world. It's in your blood.  It's you.  You have to do the right thing:  we're out in the Provinces, the Sheriff, <u>literally</u> is at our door.  You have to stand with the troops, Joe.  That's the bottom line. You <u>have</u> to...if you had the leisure to think it through, you'd see it for yourself.  The girl wasn't in the car.
I don't getcha.
For what cause?
Like dykes and dogs.
Find the money.
I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
Pay her off.
No, just the...there's no witnesses, right...?
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
I am so glad to meet you.  We are so glad to <u>have</u> you here, and <u>welcome</u> you to our...I, you know, they had c...I'm, <u>yearly</u> I redecorate our, to restore it to the, 1835...
I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
It takes all kinds.
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
Mommy's marrying Rache!
Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
Or blush.  You look pale.
Like a big sister.
...I'm not deaf, y'know.
I could help with the debate.
Yes.
Never mind.  I'll just eat my lunch.
I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
Why don't you say hello?
Annabelle pick up the phone.
No.  I think it's ugly.
No, <u>his</u> mother's always on time.
Not use my words, please!
No, baby.  You're gonna use <u>my</u> words.
That's my girl...
Annabelle put down that camera.
No.
Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!
If you want me to hate her I will.
I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
I have cancer.  Do you know what that is?
Where Ben?
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
Rache can do that part.
You say that like I don't know that.
Remarried.  There is no move.
Something's up wi...
Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
We don't have any coffee.
What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
Yes?
When I twisted hair like this it means I'm intimidated by you...
Luke.  Can't live like that.
...it's my problem, too.
How the hell would you know?
Beats me.  Ask your mom.
What else?  Keep on keepin' on.
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
Well, maybe <u>your</u> version of growing up is 'Just win, baby'.
Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here.
Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
So I'll have to order in?
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
But?  But what?
Nobody's telling them to hate you --
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
And it's <u>my</u> call.  I promised them water-skiing, instead o...
No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
Speak English.
My baby.
My grandchild-baby.
How did they execute him?
Poison gas.
Yes, I know…But still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
No, no, no. No exploitation. This is serious…But don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?
Don't worry, he doesn't mean money.
But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
The SATs, knucklehead. SCOOBY I'm not taking them.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
I'm going in there.
Sure, Dad.
Well, now you have.
Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
No.
Take off your top.
Ni...
Say, 'Nigger.'
Any books you like to read for fun?
All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
I dunno...
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
Who is this?
Great!
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then...
Eight, six, and four.
OK. Bye.
Yeah. I know.
Is this to like get into Sundance?
Doubt it.
Can I see what you have so far?
Thanks man.
Y-yes--
Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
Yeah and we don't have much ammo either!
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
I don't know.  If you gave me a reason to...
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
I'll let the senator tell you.
Mister Myers it is a chemical plant! There are a number of volatile compounds-- but they are safely stored away...
What!
Richter-we got a problem!
The thing weighs more than a ton-- you want to roll up your sleeves and try it?!
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
Did you get that, Kulnick?
I am sorry.  Sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
Give that back to me.
It's not a he, General.  It was an article in the "Times" about a year and a half ago.
See!  See, I told you.
Look, I didn't shoot him!
They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
Look, Colonel.  You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay?
Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
No, sir.
I know it sounds crazy, sir, but we tried, and nobody answers any of the telephones.
Yes, sir.  He issued attack orders to --
You aren't sure!
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
Yes?
I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
This is General Ripper speaking.
Yes, sir.
Do you recognize my voice?
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter.
Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
And if that were true?
Just a squirt.
I'm trying to, sir.
If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
Major, I hate to say this, but I think you've been enemy indoctrinated, and you don't even know it.
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
He says they've only shot down three planes.
Well, the Premier doped it out pretty well. Its primary is their missile base at Laputa.
Lothar, take your checks now.
Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.
Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
Forget it.
Skip it and jump, damn you!  This flak's so close, I can smell it.
When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?
As soon as I've checked over the route. About five minutes.  All right?
Listen, give me a shot quick!
No, I think it means, "Recall period Mistake," and the OPE is probably the CRM-114 code. Terry?
Why should they call us back?
Look, this is different.
Take it easy, Major Kong.
Okay, how do we know they didn't shoot down one of our planes and torture the crew?  How do we know that?
But I get a red light.
But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
Roger.
Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
Can I have some?
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
What did you guys think?
It's really not about anything.
A cloud?
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
Your a nurse?
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
Yeah.
Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.
No, no.
No, he's not with a girl.
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
She's dead.
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
Tim...
Wait, what happened to the tree?
Oh, you were in the band?
I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Well, play it, man.
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Wait, I'll get you some air.
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
He is.
It's a mistake to think that.
I'm sorry.
Oh, sure.
Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Hi, I'm Erica.
Uh-huh.
Sooze wants to see him.
Well, w-what happened?
I hit her.
You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?
Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
Is that Bee-Bee?
Come on!
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
Complicated or not, life moves on. Hm?
Look, why do you care, huh?
It's a piece.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.
So you can give me more shit?
Name one.
What? What do you stand for?
Um, because you didn't want to go.
It got that close.
Come with me.
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
Mm-hm.
My goal is to make art.
Mm-mm.
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
I, yeah.
Where are you going?
Wait. What, what are you saying?
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
Oh, no, no, no.
'Bye, Jeff.
Just go.
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
Yeah.
Like songs?
For a while.
No, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, I just stay at the Four Seasons. It's easier.
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
Well, what about this?
Go ahead! They love you just about as much as I do.
What are you saying?
Look at you!
It's pretty exciting.
Yeah?
You do not want me to do your cover.
Would I get paid?
Alright!
That was so great!
Mine too.
I don't know. I say what I mean.
I think about you. I mean, a lot.
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Just one?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Oh that's nice for you.
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
Bye.
That's right.  So all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes.
I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
Uh, yes.  Yes you did.
Sorry.  My hands are tied.
Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  I'm gonna visit my mom!
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
Bullets?  No bullets!  Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full.  You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it.
Hold on...
Well technically, I don't think I'm a virgin anymore.
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
'Cause I will Jerry Springer you faster than you can say "Fat-assed lesbian!"
My what?
Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
I want to help.  I'm part of this squad...
Close, but no cigar.
What's wrong with it?
That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.
So you take Plot 27-A, make it glossy, make it slick --
I didn't.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
Constantly.  No, in all serious- ness, it's really good.  It's fun writing again.  I'm happy here, honest I am.
Oh, that.  It's from a friend of mine.  A middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.
I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
Second generation, huh?
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
Of course I love him.  I always will.  I'm just not in love with him any more.
What happened?
This is where you live?
No.
Nobody asked you to.
Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
What assistant?
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
I don't care anyway.  I want the coffin to be white.  And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep pink.
It is not.  Get out.
You are! Writing words, words! You've made a rope of words and strangled this businessl But there is a microphone right there to catch the last gurgles, and Technicolor to photograph the red, swollen tongue!
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
It's getting kind of late --
Where do you live?
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
Careful, it's slippery.  I had it waxed.
You think this is all very funny.
What's that?
Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough.
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.
Maybe deMille is shooting.
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
I haven't done anything, Norma.
It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.
You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
No one leaves a star.  That makes one a star.
Go on in.
Madame is waiting.
It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.
Good.
She is upstairs.
You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
All right.  Camera!  Action!
It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself to  Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm starting to repeat myself here with this airy, glittery stuff....
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!
No, a super girl.
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
It's for your own protection.
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
You love me?
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news.
We can't do that.
Why not ?
What do you feel about me?
You can't just abandon me.  Alone.
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
Well, there's several ways to go .
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
What an adorable hat.
Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
George---I thought you'd never ask.
Nice to meet you.
Theories?
Yes.
How do you know?
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
Nonsense.
A cheap trick.
What? Palace? Hardly.
I knew it!
No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Brad.
Clark.
The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
You know, I was just thinking, Lana --  -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis --
No. I mean, yes they are, but I was talking about that.  Wheat King. Bet your bottom dollar that's a Wheat King thresher. 
Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Mom and I do this all the time.
Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.
What kind?
Nope, but --
So where is all them half-centses?
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
First question got to be "Where."
That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
Greed!  Let me tell you something---
KRYPTONITE!
I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
Is this whitemail?
Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
Hey, you're perfectly safe.
A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
That wasn't me. That guy's gone.  And you're next Webster.
There is no handle! You just push a button.
Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that.
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
No, of course not, Lois. You just get carried away sometimes. Believe me, I understand --
Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !
Clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what you're not.
Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
Wrong.
Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory?
He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.  You do, don't you, Kent?
The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
Where?
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
It will. Starting with your own.
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you! Come! Come, and kneel before Zod!
Free!
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
And I will lead.
We must combine our strength.
What about here?
Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.
I'm sorry to see you go.
Stuff it.
Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
I think he has his own plan, Uncle Lex.
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?
Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
I've been on the job.
Not in Metropolis it isn't. This is the home of the sneak attack, the stab in the back, the --
He may have a gun!
You described the exact contents of my purse.
No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
Is that what they're calling him?
Oh.
Your father was a sick weirdo.
Exactly, Miss Teschmacher.
I'm going to bed.
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!
What are you going to do to him?
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
Of course I can. I love you.
Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
He'll be weightless.
And it is forbidden for you to interfere with human history. All you can do, Kal-El, even now that you have...found yourself...is help them to evolve. Set an example. Show them they must strive towards the light. And... remember us...
Okay, but...why?  No offense.
Oh, God! I'm going to die!
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
Thirty-five.
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
No speeches, Otis. Just watch what Albert has prepared.  What are you waiting for?
Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long?
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
It's a Twinkie, boss.
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
But...why?
You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
Which one?
She's in trouble?
No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
Case?
I'm telling you this because... we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel.
I'm telling you this because we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel...
Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...
Was it good?
It just seems...kind of weird.
Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
How?
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
Just like we look forward to this.
Well I don't.
No.  I saw it on his face.
Berry-picking.
What do you mean?
That's right.
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
Yes.
Anything you didn't understand?
Why would he be frightened?
The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear.  They were the only parents who did that, together like that.  I guess they're what you might call hippies.
A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you.
Well, winter's far behind us now.
Yes.  It's a present.
Jenny, it's time for you to go to bed.
What's a ditty again?
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
Hard to say.  I might have...some business here.
Is this it?
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
Yes.
Yes.
You are angry, aren't you, Mrs. Otto?  That's why I'm here.  To give your anger a voice.  To be your
It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.
Listen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very carefully.  I do know what's best.
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.
In what way?
Any criminal record?
Yes.
Why were you scared?
Yes, I understand.
Dolores was driving too fast.
Seventy-two miles an hour.
Yes.
You remember this?
Yes.  I do now.  Now that I'm telling it.
Really?
It's okay.
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
I don't know.
But of course...
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
I'm late for a date with a dame.
Hurry back.
I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...
Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!
He's here, isn't he?  Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
Son, you raise your voice again and you'll be outa here on your golden pratt!
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.
Why?  Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice?  Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?  You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace!
Son, I don't fancy shooting mosquitoes with elephant guns.  So suppose you just shuffle along and call it a day...
Who said Sidney?
I said Sidney!...
J.J., Steve isn't...
Before you leave, son, I'll answer your question---Susan Hunsecker is the injured party here!  Or will I be hearing next that I don't even have my sister's welfare at heart...
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
I have a message from your sister.
Not just this minute, J.J....
Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?
I read your column every day...
Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job.
I like that, too.  Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.
Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
- He's got them on him.
At the bar - Sidney...
So take five minutes!  Get acquainted!  He's an important man - he's lonely - don't be dumb!
Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.
Joan, call a cop!  We'll arrest this kid for larceny!
Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?
I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.
Let me try mine.
No way!
It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.
Why?
Just say "I swear I won't kill anyone."
Chill out, dickwad.
No.
No!  Don't kill him!
I know, Mom.  I know.
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
I see.  So you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up?
Son of a bitch, I knew it!
Relax now, Sarah --
You think you're alive and safe, but you're already dead.  Everybody, you, him...  everybody... you're all fucking dead!
Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.
That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
That's big of him.
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
David, what are you Counsel for the Defence now?  Did you hear the question?
You bet.
and totally irrelevant.
But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
I've had two meetings with him. He's a great musician. Maybe the greatest conductor in the world. His Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert - unequalled.
We're dealing with degenerates here.
Yes.
There have been messages for you.  A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
How come?
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
I wasn't told. I just knew it.
How?
Oh boy, you're gonna love this. Take your time with this now. Those files contain the details of every working artist in this country. Those files are gonna tell us who joined the Party, who informed and who was helpful.
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
But you see what I'm getting at? You get a gorgeous house, you're highly paid. What are you gonna do, stay or leave? One voice comes back at me: stay!
Of course I know what that is.
Excuse me. Did you know that he refused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler was present in the audience?
Yeah?
Yes.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
First oboe.
Absolutely not.
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
I won't let the fat kid down.
Great.
Forget it?  Are you crazy? Let me see it.
Just talk.  Tell me about my son.  Is he tall?
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
You must have had a fun child-
Don't say that.
Ticklish?
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
I know.
I just called.
Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?
Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way, vote your shares...
I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...
Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
Don't just stand there, get help!
I'm sorry, about this...
How do you know that's the way?
Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
You first.
No.
What's C.R.S.?
They'll love that.
I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.
I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
That's a lie...
Who the fuck cares?
Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
Nicholas...
... what... ?
What are you doing?
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
Bullshit.  They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
I have to show you...
Originally, Connecticut.
Studied acting, I assume?
Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
I redecorated.  What about you?
Really?
I said I would...
Are you still on mediction?
What's this all about, Connie?
What have they been doing to you?
Okay... okay.
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
This... ?  Oh, this is just... this is the bill.
Yeah.
Split it?
I don't speak Spanish.  All I need is to get back... just enough for that.
Yes.
Of course you can have it if you need it.  Can I get you something to eat?
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
Oh, here we go...
I don't want money.  I'm pulling back the curtain.  I'm here to meet the wizard.
Guess!
Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.
I'm just like him.
A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...
Friend... why don't you back off.
I did okay.
Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?
I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here.
Where in the hell can she be.
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit.  I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you.
But there's a sad catch to the story.
How do you feel about Luke's suggestion that it was just the old plumbing?  Water hammer, something like that?
All right...
I don't know.  A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on.  Hugh Crain, would you care to dance?
How'd I know it was for you?
It's okay... we're all here...
I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
Who?
It's all I could afford.
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
What do you do?
Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch.
-- but the painting!
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
Am I a thing?
No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
It's not a knock.
I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
It must've been a time.  A golden moment.
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
I dunno ... Maybe they do.
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
She didn't write to me, did she.
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be allowed.
First in, first out, that's me.
You think a fuckin' guy like that ever will?  What more do you want, man?
Not much -- you?
Same.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
She used to pinch 'em off me.  Funny that.  One thing she never tried to get me to stop.
How d'you mean?
I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
Try calling me again.
In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...
I might've been away for the weekend.
Something like that, yeah.
-- Mr. Lindgren.
On what.  What makes you so certain.
I'll bloody well ask him.
She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
Tell us about it.
Who remembers.
It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
What about your grandmother?
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
Up the coast.
Fancy it?
What's in Big Sur?
Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
Yeah.  Cheers, mate.
Where else?
Five thousand.
I don't know.
And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
What d'you mean, any happier?
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
You bet.
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now.
I miss my kids.
Susan.
You must know Ian.
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
Be seein' you.
Tell me.
About Jenny.  Tell me about Jenny.  About the <u>deal</u>.  Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard.
<u>Why</u> then.  Why did you do it!
Yes. Thank you.
We went camping last summer. In Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene, Ed.
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
Did she make mistakes?
No. I might be interested in that, uh, business proposition--
And how do we share--
It's OK.
OK. Take your coat, Ann?
She's a rare one.
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
...Huh?
I, uh...
I, uh... thanks.
Dave.
I didn't say a word.
You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer.
Honey...
Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright.
...OK.
Terrific. Your husband backs you up. That's terrific.
I... just knew. A husband knows.
No thanks.
He a good man?
Yeah, the best.
I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
Whuddya mean?
No thanks, I--
Hey, what's your problem, friend? This is a business establishment with posted hours--
Second chair.
His eyes are open.
You'll go to the prison hospital.
There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them?
I'm in.
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
Where's the walk-in safe?
What's the combination?
That's great if you're stopping a burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are there motion detectors?
That would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  One more question.  I see a big hole.  If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.
Whose footprints?
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
This on top of the scratches... isn't it proof!
You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing.
Not so loud.
What's that doing here?
I'd say we're in its home.
I don't believe it.
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough these days.  According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
Keep the animal quiet.
But at what a price.
It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.
Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!
Maybe not.
You were afraid of him, weren't you?
Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?
All right.  If you're positive.
I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
But this isn't the jungle!  This is New York.  How did it get here?  A thing like that crossed two continents.  It makes no sense!
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
It's coming.  Run.
Whatever that thing is, we have to kill it!
Viti Levu.  For how many?
I'm sorry.  I don't have anything for at least a month.
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?
What's to see?
All prop cars accounted for?
What have we missed?
What music?
<i>Storm</i> music...Wagner...
Do it!
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.
As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.
In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue.
People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
And it's all available in the "Truman" Show" catalogue.  Operators are standing by.
The Hague for Christof...The Hague?...lost them.  Hollywood, California, you're on "Tru Talk."
Sure she would.
Saturday?
I think I've studied enough.
I...I can't.
So when are you leaving?
Sorry, I'm way behind.
Who?
This is where it started.
Things.  Things that doesn't fit.  Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something?
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
This is different.  Everybody seems to be in on it.
It's a surprise.
They're...  perfect.  Thank you.
A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw.  We got three of his fingers back on.
Did something happen today?
Oh, God.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
It looks so small.
Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.
Just listen.  You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan--
--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore."
I'd ask for identification.
Yeah.
They took her --
I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
Yes. I know.
Incinerate it. Like the others.
Of what?
Kurtzweil, we think.
Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that's the thing...
You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
Do you?
I don't either, but it sure sells books.
What did it look like?
You didn't know my father --
I told you -- he and I were old friends --
I'm on the roof.
No. I haven't.
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
Scully, I found the bomb.
Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
Why not? It's three AM.
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
I can't really talk right now.
What did you find?
What kind of infection?
Mulder --
All the equipment is brand new.
No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks.
I don't know, Mulder.
I don't know why I think they went right.
Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
Yeah...?
After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --
I need you on this, Scully --
I don't know anything about that.
Thank you.
About what?
I have answers for you.
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --
Where is he?
What alien environment?
And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
That's my girl.
Baked in a pie.
I know.
How hard could it be...?
What did you see?
You're the shrink, you tell me.
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
What difference does it make...?
Oh no... No you don't.
Prevacid.  For my stomach.
No.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
Awaiting his arrival.
Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
Dr. Winkel told me that.
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
I know. I wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
Tell me more.
Anna.
I don't know.
Oh...
I saw him today.
There's something wrong. Did you tell Calloway about meeting Harry?
No.
No.
What did you say? I'm sorry...
Well, I've got it when you want it, miss.
Yes, of course.
You a friend of Lime's?
You're not locking her up?
I'm not asking you to.
How about the doorway?
Oh, there you are. Come in here, there isn't much time.
She's right. It's none of my business.
I said you win.
Well, there's not much time.
This way, miss.
You know, Paine's one of your devoted readers. He's promised...
No, I don't know...
I know a very good dentist.
I don't need a dentist. Somebody hit me, that's all.
What is it, Sergeant?
Tough...tough...Don't worry, old man, they won't hurt her.
At the end of every chapter --
But you will.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Thank you.
In great pain?
You remember me? Upstairs...
What does he say?
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
Why didn't they bring him in the house?
Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
Der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. I should have listened to my wife. She said you were up to no good. Gossip.
Never.
Where are you staying?
Richard. Hi.
We moved rooms because of him.
Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
So?
We think in miles, not kilometers.
Richard?
I think it's a bad idea to tell anyone.
There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
He's an asshole.
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
People still need values, beliefs....
I don't care about money.
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.
The sex is better.
Even though his dick is so big?
No difference.
What's it about?
Why should I submit?
You want a punch in the mouth?
You gotta get out of here.
They used to. Today it's not an issue.
A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.
I've been waiting all my life for something like this.
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
I agree.
Differences exist, of course, but they're irrelevant. For the Jew, his Jewishness dominates everything. Even the ones who renounce it, who hate it, who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife...can't escape. They're still just Jews.
Does that mean you deny what he says is true? Yes or no.
How do you reconcile the two?
I thought you hated Torah.
You're lying.
I don't do that.
It's German.
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
The Bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. But chickens don't give milk.
Look, you want cheese, go someplace else.
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.
Green dot -- shotgun powder. For pipe bombs.  A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me. A donation to the cause.
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
So what do we do with the device?
JTS...?
Are you an artist?
You want to kill a Jew. I already did.
Leary?
We think you'd be good at it.
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
Some people say it's the most virile sport in the world.  One has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea, all muscles contracted in one super human effort...
How do you know that?
Why?
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
What does that mean?
Have the car painted.
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
And... does the voice come back?
Try speaking to me?
Great!
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
Thank you.
Why?
You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there...  and you decide that you will die for them... Only then do they start coming out.  They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... If it's sincere.  If it's pure... They will be with you and take you away forever.
You'll understand.
You are the father.
Where I saw the mermaids?!  Why don't you ever ask any question? I'm always the one asking the question!  We're sitting here like two stones and I'm taking to myself. Ask me something, Goddamnit!
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
Louis, we were French!
They got the new T.V.
They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
That's the experiment?  Dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
It's Esther.
C'mon follow me.
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
Not if I can help it. You got any information for me?
It's cool. It's cool. Aveenooh Shalom Alechem, brother.
I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.
Now this might get a bit technical, but try and stay with me. Using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators, called the Internet, I can access surveillance maps, villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter.
Take a look.
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?
Nice fellow?
I drink.
Let's get in your truck.
That's the place: I remember -— My feet were so darn sore, I couldn't make it -- and Galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --
All men are fools. They like to make a big show -— shout and hunt --
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches ——
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths —— that's what this procession is supposed to be.
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
That's right, of course.
Sure -- certainly —- but what's that got to do with this?
It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
Yes, but what sort of a man?
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
All right -- the dead, then.  In history there must have been men like that -- men with kinks in their brains --
Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
To know where that leopard went - — I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little fresh—water college back East. I gave that up.
No —- really, I can see them -- they're coming now -— turn off the lights ——
I know all that, chief, and I don't like it any better than you do, but there's something else --
Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.
Makes no difference.  Get him out.
You. Us.
I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
We will ——
We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I.
Must it?
That might depend on where you’re going.
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
Well, Leon does not need money for prints, Mr Lombard. Does his own printing. Wouldn’t want anyone to interfere with his ‘Art’!  Which, as he subsequently vanished, raises the question: what was the money for? Perish the thought.
Oh-oh! Touché, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  No. Don’t. You might get confused speaking of things you don’t understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until you’ve done what we are paying you for.
Can it be that easy?
Disney! How inter...
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
...7548. Have you... Have you found him yet?
Have you finished?
You knew he had nothing to do with your brother’s disappearance, didn’t you?
Something like that.
You seem to know what you’re talking about.
My husband didn’t need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
No. Not us...
The dead can wait.
How come you’re alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
Right... Well, I’ll get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. There’s a dirt track with a ‘Closed to the public’ sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you haven’t heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
Then find another way.
And losing you, we’d lose him. And that would be a shame, don’t you agree?
Who?  Martin... He’s Martin...
What?
Finsbury Park. We’re in Finsbury Park.
B-Black...
Good.
I don’t know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
Bye bye, Jane. And don’t be naughty.
Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldn’t like to think I’d kept you waiting for nothing.
Must I speak to you in French?
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
What I can appreciate is insolence, Mr Lombard!
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
I’m sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
I’m overcome by your public-spiritedness.
Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where they’re not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
I’ll be alone.
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
Leon? No. I’m afraid he left.
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
You-you’re wrong. I just called to ask if I could stay with him next time I’m in London. That’s all.
Yeah... But he didn’t beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parent’s leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
Do you know Leon’s parents names?
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leon’s story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
Er... Yes...
... No. In fact, I’d seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasn’t getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesn’t appeal to you...
Could that be Camden Market?
Cinq cents.
Où est passé ton salon?
Who?  I don’t know who the fuck you’re talking about, sunshine.
Five seconds. Then you die.
Three...
Gluck’s dead, you sonofabitch!
Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
They lost their son. Why?
So... pretend it's not a game.
Very generous of you all.  How much?
We have to do something before she tries it again!  I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
No.  I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
I thought you were an archer?
I promise...
Yes...
It's over, Jeanne.  We won, just as you said!
Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
You don't know what you're saying. You're going to leave this place, Jeanne -- you're going home -- or whatever you want -- you're going to be happy, and have children, and...
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
I don't remember.  Maybe.
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
Yes, but...
No, I... I never killed anyone!
How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
The English??
Were you baptized?
Yes.
Buying her?
This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace.  If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles.
Not yet.
The English won't wait.
Me too...
Perfectly.
He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  It proves your desire to deceive...
It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers...
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
Why not?  He has good teeth...
Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
Won?!  Such a small word will never do!  This is victory, Jeanne, this is... glory!
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
I said, kneel!
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
I need to confess.
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
He never says his name.
Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
Really?
No one plays Chopin like you.
He'll be here soon.
Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
Here.
What's happened?
Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
Calm down, what, what is it?
Thanks.
Tough luck.
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.
Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
So, what's the news?
You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
There are always notices going up.
Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don't be offended, I didn't call to discuss my future career.
I was listening, Kitten.
You made contact?
It's a little cut, nothing.
A pianist.
In the attic.
Not yet.
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
Watch his hand
You have spare wife here Peini. You get rnana for that. Our chief four wives.
She's stunted, that's one thing.
No, no they know another track - to the side of this.
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
Everyone has to practice.
You got a bag or somethin?
How 'bout a handkerchief?
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see who's in town.
No.  Never saw him before.  He's a dick, though.
I had some appointments.
How much did ya lose?
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
Aw, I got a brother down in K.C., runs a freight outlet.  I can go halfsies with 'em!  It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side.  How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I've got to compete with that?
Which way did he do, Eirie?
You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now.  If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first...Damn, there's no answer at Luther's.
All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
All he's gotta do is read.
You sober?
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
You know anything about him?
I never played for winos.
Did he say he wouldn't?
You can't play your friends like marks, Hooker.
Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
We'll give him the hook on the train, and play him here.  You think I can get in that poker game, Eddie?
What are the odds on Syphon?
You're more gutless than I thought.
What for?  I haven't done anything.
Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
I don't know.  Depends what train I get on.
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
You're a lucky man, all right.
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.
Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations.  We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
I think he will.
I never tried to kid you reporters -- I'm telling you the truth.
Is that what it means?
Of course.
I'm sorry.
Another young man.
Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
You're talking like a crazy person,
Why not?
I don't believe it! You're lying!
Did he tell you where he was going?
Yes.
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
Disappeared!
Why... in the heart.
Oh, yeah?  People fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  I knew you were lying.
You see how much we have to say.
A new invention?
You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
And he still wants to marry me!
Only in bad weather.
Better get home before it is.
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
You mean about that gun?
Man to man, I'm not.
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
Seen any signs of it, Bill?
Well....
About three.
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
I didn't mean you, Mister.
I said all right!
Chris -- Chris -- !
I thought you said you weren't going there.
supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
You're going to return every cent of it!
That's all right.
That's just why I'm going.
Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
All right - you didn't.
Thank you.  Now I'll tell you why I know Wynant didn't commit those murders -  Three months ago - the night that he caught you in Julia's apartment, he found out that Julia was cheating him, and was splitting with some man.  He went to find the man. That man was.... Tanner, don't you...?
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
Six Martinis.  You're not going to have anything on me.
I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
That's jolly.
I'd like to see you work.
Someone get a doctor.
Want a drink?
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
Yes.
Oh take it!  Please take it!
Maybe I will.
I don't believe he did it.
What are you going to do?
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
Not with all your money!
Goodbye, darling.
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
I did find him!
Nick!
Why not?
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations. 
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
Trying to put it off on her?
Yes.  Nick!
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
I'm fired.
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.
I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here.  You don't learn it in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in high school.
Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
I'd settle for being alive.  Really. Alive would be fine.
How tough you have to be to make the army?  All you've got to do is shoot a gun, and stop a bullet.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
You just go when I say go.
Should have at least gotten the map off of him.  Blows up with him then we did all this for nothing.
The soldiers are going to kill those people!
I heard!
He's an enemy soldier.
He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
No you're not.
Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
But we all got to be in for this.  We all go, or we do nothing.
A car?  You're going to buy a car?
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
It's the only way.  We drive!
Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
We leave it.
Yeah.  I know.  I'm with you.
I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all.  Just a sip.
I heard it click.
Why you got to move away to talk!?
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
That's going to do it, right?  I'm going to be okay.
Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.
It's a fire fight.
Something like that.
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
If they land, we can take them.  If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.
I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
It's giving.
Not when you're up here with the gold, I guess not.
We need something:  A flare, a signal mirror.
I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
I don't want to die.
It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
No!
You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
Well, we should identify ourselves.
Probably.
They must be Saudis.  It's a Saudi checkpoint.  Oh sweet, Jesus.  Come on. Come on!
I just said I would.  I don't think I--
I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.
Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold. If we gave it to them they might let us live; they might not kill us.
When did you make the switch?
It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
I don't know.
That's what I hear.  Don't matter.  Girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold.
They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
What is it?  You know so much about Arabland tell me what it is.
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
You will.  You'll get it.
We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
It's a container.  Break the seal.
Yes!
A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.
I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
We make it, or we go back empty handed.
Yeah, we're down.
All last night he could have been--
Violation?
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading.
Vocasity
I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
It's 3+27 hundred
They'll come for me right away if I'm not there.  I have to go.
You don't know.  You don't....
They don't know.
I've said many times before, and I guess I'll have to repeat it again for your...
We're leaving.
Ask him about the air.  He looks out of breath.
What?
Where's LUH?
What?
When?.....How?
What are you talking about. How do you know?  I need her!  I need her.  She needs me.  I've got to get to her.
You don't know that!
No thanks, Bev.
Just do it.
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
Bingo!
What?
Where you guys at?
Off the scale.
He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote.  Okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor.
Okay, let's go in.
People are dying.
Take him!
What kind of bomb was it?
She wanted to cook me breakfast.
IRA - instant retirement account.
Goddamit, Reilly--
Report on the case so far.
Pull back. You're only an observer.
At once, Jacques.  We'll continue later.
In a moment.
<u>Tonsili!</u>
No!
Good morning.  I'd-I'd-I'd like to look at some cuff links.
You're looking fine, Major.
Now see here, my good man. I've had just about enough of your insulting remarks!
The type they marry.
You can trust me.
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
I've got to see you.
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
M'sieu ...
Monescu.
Good day, Major.
I would like to.
The pepper, too?
Yes! Don't you remember the day you took that Chinese vase from the Royal Palace  and made it into a lamp for my night table?
Darling!
Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doña Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
Not particularly.
The pleasure is mine, madame.
Oh! You didn't read it!
Then I'm glad I lost the bag! I'll write you the check immediately. 
As you like. 
Yes!
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
This used to be my secretary's room.
Ye-es?
Then lunch in the Bois--
Then a little nap--
Marvelous.
Lipstick?
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
Mariette!
Adolph J. Giron.
Yes, Madame Colet?
Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
I know!
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
May I?
About what?
How much is your salary?
Oh, madame, you're just too sweet for words! 
Then why did you do it?
You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
Well, he was in the navy.
Didn't you take it with you?
But you saw it here.
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
Don't you mean work me?
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
Bollocks.
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
Of course I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best, but what a glorious end to your last crossing if we get into New York Tuesday night and surprise them all.  Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?
Could I speak to you in private?
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
Well, here you are.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
No, no! Just with her hands.
Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay.
I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
It's so cold.
Yes sir.
What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
You think she was really there?
Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.
Of course it's unfair! We're women. Our choices are never easy.
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something.  Shall I see you tomorrow?
And <U>do</U> bring Miss Marsh--  --when she's had time to tidy up a bit.
Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless-- see you later.
Where's Lother?
If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink. 
That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
Yes--are you?
Married?
But--
I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
What's the matter?
Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
How're the tips?
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
Thank you.  I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
<U>Me</U>!
Three Jacks.
Why isn't that a good time to quit?
Think again--
I'll go with you--
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
I'll go with you.
I'm sorry to hear that.
How?
In New York.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?
Next month is June.
O.K.! Send that!
Sure.
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
That's news to me. I'd better cable my wife.
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
Yes!
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
No--not much--excepting-- 
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
Of course--but--  There's your cue--hurry up--
I'm getting seasick--
No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--
Good-night, folks.
Easy kid--easy....  Come on--I want to talk to you.
That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
--you'd go with him!
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
Because I was yellow, I guess--
This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
Good night!
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
Sure, Sis.
Well--get a move on yer--then get back to yer station.
Let me look at it.
Because you ran after me.
500? Sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.
Well now that's a little more Like it.
This brand.
But wait, you don't understand-
And you must be Ringo.  Look, Darling, Johnny Ringo.  The Deadliest pistoleer since Wild Bill, they say.  What do you Think, darling?  Should I hate him?
Credat Judaeus Apella.
I was kidding about that.
Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
I know him.  That's Creek Johnson.
How you feelin', Doc?
Then what do I do?
Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!
Good God, you're really-
Cards in spades.  I'm in love with Every second of her life.  Hell, I'll probably love her when I'm dust.
Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy?
Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy As the next man, I guess.  I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean.
Then let's make sure we get our Money's worth
Wait!
Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?
Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem. You don't have to mix up in this.
Really?  You sure?
You know nothing.  What you don't Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most.  You're never Yourself, you never relax.  Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself.  Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh.  But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold.  What's between you and that Jew woman?
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
You're the boss.  One thing, though.
Not anymore, not after this.
All right, run 'em off.
We'll go around that way, come up on foot.
Hope so.  Clean up with this boy.
Hey, Wyatt, God damn it, I'm serious!
Yeah?
500... Year's wages.  And I never even saw a horse like that.
Hit a streak when we left.  Him And Kate.
You are the one, Wyatt.  You sure are.
You'll never make that stick.
All right, Virge, your call.  But Give Doc the shotgun.  They'll be Less apt to get nervy if they see Him on the street howitzer.
Bring up the tracking satellite. And get 007 out of there.
Sir Elliot.
So why did you leave?
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs. We'll drown her at sea.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
I'm sorry.
Four o'clock. Don't be late.
Ah, James. You always were a cunning linguist... Au revoir, mon cher.
In the darkest moments, it's what I live for. Especially since I've heard how much you like to watch... On the hidden camera.
Standard equipment. The world's automobile manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide the most beverage cup holders.
Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him.
Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.
How is old Q?
Oh. I almost forgot. There is one last thing: Before Q retired, he asked that I give you one other protective device.
Let's take a look at the body.
Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?
Seized it from a guy smuggling computer chips out of Bangkok.  Should have seen his rose garden: Blooms the size of hand grenades.
We work in the dark. We do what we can.
Thanks.  Take care -
You too.
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
You are seriously deranged.
Maybe. But why are we going up instead of down?
Yes, M.
'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press.
Sabotage?
Captain Morton.
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
Excellent.
I see you two have met.
One to seven: Deal the face cards.
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
We got the same thing.
You always got something to say.
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
I would like to finish reading this. What would I talk about? I haven't read this month's almanac. I don't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes. They pride themselves in making life hard and that's not my cup of tea.
I don't need that kind of love. And I don't want to be reminded all the time that Big Mama's grandmother was born in slavery. If you really care about me, just tell me how I can make money.
You were in hell?
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
I'm busy.
Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.
Son, I can take everything you got with that deck. It is marked. Now I'm going to show you how to make some money in case you get stuck somewhere.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
You're going to find yourself on the floor.
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
He knows better. Sunny, apologize to Harry.
I'm going to wash up now. You all please excuse me.
Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.
I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
Well, I don't want to put you out.
All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is.
Only if you can spare it.
I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush?
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
Well, you and your husband are special. Ya, Gideon tells me you do volunteer work to help feed the poor.
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.
Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you say?
You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
Country people got so many strange ways,
I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth.
Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter?
I'm sorry he got those birds.
It is so considerate of you.
I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
No, I haven't seen him.
Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
Woody!  Buzz!
I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
Yes, I can.
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
Look at me!  I can't even fly out of a window!
Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!
Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
We've got to get out of here...NOW.
Stay calm, everyone!!
Sorry there, old Spudhead.
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
Toss 'im overboard!
Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
Come in, Mother Bird. Alright...Andy's opening the first present now.
I can't quite make out -- 
I knew you'd come back, Woody!
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
A sin against <i>what?</i>
Can you move over a wee bit?
Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.
I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
Don't you have some good news?  Isn't there something positive you could say.
What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that?  You've compromised me and our relationship --
That's frustrating.
Me, too.
Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  I tried --
Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?
God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?
I don't know.
So's the video camera.
She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.
How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
Tell me what to do, Carl.  I need guidance, not a fucking platitude.  I'm not bringing a child into the kind of life I grew up with.  I won't do it.  I want our life back.
You can't make me.
Oh, yes I can.
Sixteen
Do you work?
Cincinnati Country Day.
I'm third in my class.
You do?  What else you do?
Maradona is a cokehead.  Hand of God, my ass.  We're wasting our time here.
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
That thought makes me feel awful.
What's he doing up here?
They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone.
We keep our mouths shut.
What is it you want me to do?
Any idea how much?
We ask questions and measure the answers.  When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year.  Now it's almost double.  Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.
Sure.  More money in intelligence on their side of the border.  So we have a better idea who we're looking for.  More dogs.  More people. Supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through.  Outside of martial law that's about the best you're gonna do.  But, I should tell you, there are two things that really have us on edge right now.  In the last six months seizures have tripled, even though we're pulling over the same number of cars.  What does that tell you?
She snuck away.  And we haven't seen her.  She hasn't come home.
Addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.
I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --
He's a research doctor.  You're dad's a doctor, too --
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
Let's face it, it could have been wonderful.
Jesus.
And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.
Certainly not.
Unless you get caught.
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
What? Steady like?
Happy birthday.
Well, he's young and he's healthy.
Eh? How's that?
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
No.
Clear?
No problem.  No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.
Right.
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
The only drawback, or at least the principal drawback, is that you have to endure all manner of cunts telling you that -
You don't know, do you?
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
What do you mean?
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
Give me the gun.
Well, Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so humpty about it, I wouldn't have bothered. Are you going to eat that?
Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
In that case --
As you wish.
Sure will, pal, sure will.
Such as?
I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.
I don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's... normal.
I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
Then I shall make use of this starship.
You doubt me?
Rescued at last.
Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
Plotting our new course.
But how?
Go, Sulu.
MM.?
I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.
Who is it he reminds you of?
He believed the key to self-knowledge was emotion, not logic.
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
How do you know?
That's a little vague, Spock -
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
I'm sorry, Spock. I can't surrender now. I'm not through violating Neutral Zone Treaty. In fact, I'm just getting started. And now for my next violation I intend to steal something. Something very big.
No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
Yes, okay, exactement!
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
The Pentagon?
What do you want with the Pentagon?
Oh, you want to -- hah. I could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here. They hate this tower. They'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while. And you should hear the way they commune! Sounds like they were routing a payroll, for all the heart they put in it. No, I don't think you
You know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said to go take that sucker out. An' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. I feel like hittin' him now, while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters?
Yeah, I... oops!
Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
It's too far!
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
That's all going to change, Yori...
Don't know yet... I have to get in touch with Alan. He was going to tell me how to
So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.
Where are you going?
I'm not sure what to believe anymore, young lady.  You never used to lie to me.  But lately you don't seem to know the difference between right and wrong.
Yeah, Dad.
You're kidding.
Yeah, but you're not her parents, anymore, you and Helen.  Her parents are Axl Rose and Madonna. The five minutes you spend a day with her can't compete with that kind of constant bombardment. You're outgunned, amigo.
And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired.
Can we go to the office now, Mr. Superspy?
She's having an affair.
Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
I don't know.  I guess... I wanted to see what would happen.
But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--
Uh, yes, it is important.
Oral hygiene?
Me too.
What did you tell him?
Yeah.  It was great.
It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park.
Answer the question--
Yes.
Yes or no.
You wouldn't believe me.
It makes you tell the truth?
Are we going to die?
I don't take those assignments.
Harry... snap out of it!
What?
Wait here.  If you have to use this, use it.  Don't choke. Okay?
I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
Sure.  Set me up and then don't tell me.
Dickless.  If they took care of				* business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
Red hot.  Her thighs steam.
Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn!
Uh... well, okay then.  You sound terrible.  I'll run out right now.  Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy.  Sure, no problem.  Bye.
So now it's Tasker?  Not Renquist?
Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
Nope.
He wants to speak with you.
Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.  What do you think would taste good?
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
Don't eat anything.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
Do you have a fella?
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
Almost four years.
That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like?
He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr. Gene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just disguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time.
Five.
That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it." So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.
I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.  I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.
You have a pimp?
Uh-huh.
You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.
I don't believe so.
Write down Drexl's address.
What?
I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms.
Heard that.
Yeah.
He don't got no right to live.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?
Who the fuck are you?
Has he gotten his mail today?
Now tell him goodbye.
Every word of it.
I certainly hope so.
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
Is he big league?
Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.
I'm just makin' sure we got everything.  You got yours?
Yeah, let's just get outta here.
No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.
- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -
The police department?
Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
Mr. Donowitz?  I told you, through Dick.  He's in my acting class.  About a year.  Yeah, he's good.  They grew up together.  Sure thing.
Get on your knees.
That good, huh?
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou had a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us before. Am I correct?
Step inside.
Not a tiny little vial -
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.
This guy's gonna kill him.
You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.
Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.
Shit, man, you done fucked up again. Next time you bogart your way into a nigger's crib, an' get all his face, make sure you do it on white boy day.
I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?
I tell Jayne Kennedy, "Suck my dick or I'll beat your ass!"
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
Are you Dick Ritchie?
Do you know where we can find him?
Uh, what?
I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!
"James"!  Nobody ever calls me that.
July.
Do you know what year it is?
Everybody's got a gun.  In this city...
"If something really happens"...like what, James?
It wasn't me before, James.  It's become me now because of...what's happening.  Please untie me.
Clues?  What kind of clues?
What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
Who's keeping an eye on you?
Lock it now!
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
The gun! ... I lost it
No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?  Don't worry -- it's all okay now.  I'm not crazy any more!  I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me.  I want to get well...
I thought I was in...prison again.
It was?  I didn't...know.
James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
You... you left them a message?
I couldn't resist.  I was so relieved. Wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them...they better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...
They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we?
You see what I mean?  You're being defensive.  Isn't she being defensive, Bob?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
I think I've heard that before.
You afraid of the dark?
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
I'm a rich man off of thirty bucks?
You got two years on me.  What's that make me?
It is not.
But, in particular?
One way.
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
You son of a bitch!
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!
We ain't got no Beck's.
It'd serve you right.  Jose, run get a mop and clean this mess up.
Sheriff Potter.
Uh-huh
There's someone in the house.
I guess it must.
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
Come here.
I'm just flesh and blood, baby. That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys.  But you already know that.  You read my fortune.  Thanks for the lemonade.
You know what I want.
Did you ever?
I'm guessing no.
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
Grace, I can't.  I can't even get out of here myself.  I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
Because I know you're full of shit.
I could if I had Jake's money.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.
Don't yell at me!
We're going all the way.  Together.
No.
What about him?
Where are you going?
It's our money.  He had no right to take it.
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
Grace, listen to me.  In the trunk of my car is a rope.  It should reach down here.  Got get it, throw it down and I'll climb up.
The trunk.  It's locked.
It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
It's . . . it's locked.
Someone will find me.
Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
Grace, tell him.
Would I what?
Because I'm sick and tired of her little games.  Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. Because I've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.
Talk?  About what?
About things.  About your wife.
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
Make it twenty.
What should I do?
You know what I mean.
And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
Trouble with the car again?
Darrell giving you problems?
Maybe you heard old Jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you'd help yourself to a little.
I came for Grace.
Liar.
Wh . . . what are you talking about?
Christ, Jake, please--
What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
You're too quick for me.
For what?
Make time?  Is everybody in this town slap happy?
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
The old lady?
A hundred and . . . Now you listen to me you deadbeat, little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and I want it.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
Yes, Mr. Vesci.
Hello?  Hello!?  Operator, I got disconnected.  Hello . . .
He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
Like I said; you really can't blame the boy.  Some people don't know how to avoid trouble.  Know what I mean?
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
Sure, Sheriff.
Soda.  You got any soda?
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
You want something, old man?
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
You know I won't be seeing you.
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
Grace, tell him.
You've got to be--
That's a solid name.
I'm a solid man.
Would I what?
How do you know if you've never tried?
Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
You're talking like a madman.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
You meant it.
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
Two-hundred dollars?
Two-hundred dollars...I'll do it!  I'll kill her!
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
What the hell are you talking about?
Will you shut up!
Yep.
Yeah, I can fix it.
Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Soda.  You got any soda?
What happened to your hand?
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
Drove into Superior?  What for?
Where you headed?
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
A medicine man?
Come here.
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
I'm guessing no.
You could leave him.
Walk away.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Don't feel like nothing.
You don't have any money put away, do you?
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
What about us?
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.  The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it.  It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here.  But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
Can you make it back up?
And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
Get in.
...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
With a <u>shotgun</u>!  She kills <u>both</u> of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive.  I mean, what are the odds?
A hundred and ... Now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and <u>I want it</u>.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
But, in particular?
No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller.
What was that all about?
I think I burned my gun hand!
Oh?
No baby, you got it wrong.
Wrong number.
No! No! Please!
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
Four.
Oh.
I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
That counts.
You could have poured coffee in Starbucks, you could have learned to install track lighting in office buildings, you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet... You could have been one of ten thousand things... but in the end, you chose to protect people. You made that decision... and I find that very, very interesting.  Now all I need is your credit card number.
You have a problem, Elijah. My wife is right. Somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it.
He's kind of a miracle.
There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.
What things?
No Jeremy.
That's great.
In the passenger car?
...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.
I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
We was... lyin'.
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
A wise policy. But if you did, I can assure you, the sight of royalty would cause you to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed and stand... in awe.  Whereas, a president... I mean, why not shoot a president?
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
Hell, you know how Skinny is. Says he's gonna shoot 'em... an I says, "Skinny, you can't do that," an' he says, "Well, then get Little Bill down here an' let's settle this" an' I says, "Bill's sleepin', Skinny," an'...
You ain't dead.
They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
That big guy lookin' for me?
Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
Oh yeah.
Alive?
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
All week?
That much, huh?
I could run off them whores.
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death.
Well he wasn't gonna wait for Corky to grow no new hand. He walked over real close, bein' drunk, an' shot him through the liver.
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
What'd Ned say?
L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
Jesus!
I don't never see nobody anyhow.
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
Lookin' at?
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him.
If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
Yeah.
Shit... I thought they was gonna get us. I was even... scared a little... just for a minute.  Was you ever scared in them days?
First one what?
First one I ever killed.
Yeah.
Yeah?
I could tell you who was last, mister.
We done stuff before for money, Ned.
Sally?
Yeah.
You're marking us, Bill.
Fifty yards ain't bad.  Guess we better get along.
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
He's dead, Bill.
Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.
Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more.
I ain't blind, you asshole.
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
That was your idea, I wanted to...
Well, suppose he does?
&lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;
No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
A hijacker like Dean, here? Or something more creative?
I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.
Two hours, tops.
Waste of time.
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -
He was a corrupt cop, Verbal.
Sure. And I'm supposed to believe that hitting the Taxi Service wasn't his idea
What lawyer?
Came from Redfoot.
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
But Keaton...
There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two?
Yes.
Ah.  How did they treat you?
As far as we know, nothing.
This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
Say it.
Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?
And what did your team do...
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
I'm just an M.D.
I am seventy-four years old.
Do you, indeed.  I'll bet you do. Fine.  Fine.  We'll save the court the time.  We will admit the Doctor as an `expert witness,' fine.
My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price.  They wanted this cleared up in court.  They want their vindication.  I agree with them.  But for today the offer stands.  Before we begin the publicity of a trial.  For today only.    When I  walk out that door the offer is withdrawn.  As long as you understand that.  It's got to be that way.
Nothing further, your Honor.
It's a crime.
No.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
It's completely done on a contingency basis.  That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third ...that is, of course, the usual arrangement ...
I am seventy-four years old.
I am on the staff of...
It's a common medical term.
That's what I'd planned to...
Yes.  I wrote it.
I.  Yes.  It is.
) I'm sorry ...?
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?
My client can't walk, your Honor.
I know full well she can't, Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket.  You follow me?  I'm trying to help you.
Listen to me, fella...
Mr. Concannon...?
Noted.  Thank you.   Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.  Her sole rebuttal was the document,  which has been disallowed...
Missus...
Still looking.
What Hotel are you staying at?
A brick house says you divorced him.  I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner.  And I'll take your word for it.  Now you tell me the truth.  Because you cannot lie to me.  What's your name?
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...
Is there going to be a later...?
If I don't 'grow up...'
I have to talk to you.
What do you want?
To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
It's locked?
... I know.  I went ...
She told me.
Yes.
Yes, the roving nurse...
As I've said we had some more...
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
What happened in those three minutes...?
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
San Francisco's changed. The things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
Then?
That's Carlotta Valdes.
Do you live here in the hotel?
I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please!
You.
Why?
It's a place to live, that's all.
But you haven't lived here long.
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
I'll take care of you.
I want to! Come on!
No, it's not right.
We tried it. It didn't suit me.
Oh, yeah. There.
Madeleine died here.
I need you.
-- and wanted to go on loving you." And I said, "I won't lose you."  But I did.
No!
You can't. You're afraid!
I'm going to. It's my second chance.
Yes!
What are you going to do?
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
Where were you?
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
When?
Oh... wandering about.
Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
You like it, too.
That's a good occupation. And live here... alone?
No... it's wrong.
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
What was it inside that told you to jump?
What do you remember?
A grave...
A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
I had the dream. The dream came back again...
No, never!
I love you too... too late... too late...
Too late... there's something I must do...
Please. Because I love you.  He stares at her, sees the pleading look in her eyes, and lets go. She turns and walks away toward the church, slowly, her head bowed. He watches her go and starts to move after her. Then slowly, as she goes, her head begins to go up until finally, as she walks, she is staring high above her.  And then, suddenly, she breaks into a broken run.
Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out information of that sort. Our clients are entitled to their privacy, you know. And I do believe it's against the law! Of course, I don't think any of them would mind, really, but still I would have to know who you are, and ask --
When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all! I would have seen her, you know. I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves!
How do you know? Personal experience?
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
Ah, Johnny-O...
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
Carlotta?
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
What is it, a still life?
Well...
First of all...
Franco mother-fucking Harris!
And you're a little fucking reject.
You go home!
What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
It's a marble floor, we can clean it up.
We've already done this.
Wrong. That is flat out wrong. Hell is for cowards, for hypocrites who fear to live by the strenght of their own convictions. This is war. Given the circumstances, and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we have chosen life over death. Two wrongs don't make a right. So our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less.
You got us into this mess.
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
They're driving me nuts!
They're singing.
What?
What do you mean? It's it's a Goddamn Mini-Mart?!
Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little...
It has to be done.
I don't think so.
Don't sweet lip me.
Nothing happened in Vegas.
I don't want to hear it from the liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? What happened in Vegas?
Who?
No.
I'm calling the police.
Boyd...What have we done?
Say it again.
I just want to get married.
Whatever you say Kojak.
I'm serious.
And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!
You have a King fantasy.
New king.
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
Not really, no.
Ball park sausages.
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
Why did you forget the tent check?
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
Right before the wedding?
He's a moron.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
Who else?
You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
Go down where?
That's sweet.
Just a bit of organizing.
Yeah. Nesting.
Okay.
What okay?
No way.
What kind of stupid question is that?
Who's dead?
You fucked a prostitute?
Call the police.
Like how?
So what do we do?
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
Just kills me...
It means she's insecure.
Have another drink.
The wahoo?
How do you know she's dead.
I got to agree with that.
What?
That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never.
I do.
Yes, yes.
Are there many windows?
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
Then it's a respectable house.
Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
You'll think you're still at the convent.
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
Never.
Wasn't that cowardice?
You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
Go away! Leave me alone.
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.
Yes.
No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
What are you going to do?
It doesn't make any difference what she is: you like her.
Why?
That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
I'm not interested. Do what you think's best.
You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.
Why?
And let him get run over by somebody else?
Are you sure it isn't contagious?
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
You cannot leave ...
There's been an accident.
All right, Mother.
Mother.
Good, then let's go!
Have I slept long?
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
Yes or no, Mr. Barnes?
Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar —— you making it okay in there?
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
Do me a favor —— keep sending them.
If you can catch him.
Their weapons missing?
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
In other words, we collectively don't know shit.
I need your help--
I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you.
This is a full pardon. It authorizes your immediate release.
If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.
Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
He hears...everything.
It's nano—technology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
It feels so.. .real.
How do you kill it?
Think hard -- it'll come to you...
Help me get out of here.
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
Go to hell.
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
What you need is a collar.
It wasn't a lie.
Every time I said it, it was. I never really thought I was going to make it.
Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
How did you get your hand out?
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
You know I am.
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
More or less.
Lindenmeyer?
BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD!
<u>Lure</u> him. 
No, this is great.
I don't think you're gonna need it.
Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
What are you talking about?
When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.
I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane <u>right now</u> to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the <u>Boeing</u> people.
What's it gonna cost? 
...that's the general idea.
Why?
Well, I'm <u>working</u> on it....
The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?
...what's the Long View?
I <u>live</u> for midnight, when I can tear another of those suckers off.  Watcha got for me?
<u>I</u> think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...? 
<u>Yes</u>:  she is saying this in Albanian, <u>but</u> she's doing it not to be uh...  But because, she explains, that is the only way it can be understood by her Aged and Sainted Mother, who is standing there with her, dressed in her Traditional...
...uh huh...
Knock on wood.
Y'wanna follow the Cattle Drive?  Sleep in the Winter. What does <u>Moss</u> want...?  Matchmaker comes to the Levinsky Family.  Mr. Levinsky, Mrs. Levinsky, would you entertain an offer of marriage for your son Saul, from Princess Margaret of Great Britain.  Well, they think, she isn't Jewish, but she's well to-do, a nice old family.  Alright, yes, they say.  We would consider such an offer.  Wonderful, matchmaker says, My Job is Half Done.  Now, Look:  I got the <u>file</u>, from the L.A. contingent, I got the day-by-day, of how...
Waal, I gotta tell you.  I've been inside the Beltway fourteen years, and I feel like I Just Got My Feet Wet.
Brazen it through?  Brazen it <u>through</u>?  They're going to hang us out to dry like the <u>laundry</u> --- do you know what we've <u>ddd</u>...
What are we gonna <u>do</u> about it...?
Fine. 
Well, you know, "The Whole Thing's Theatre..."
...what are we going to do...?
How do we explain <u>that</u>?
Where's my pill...?
From whence did it come?  Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  Of Armed and Violent Dissidents...
ON CAIN, AS SHE LOOKS AROUND.
Well, that's what we're <u>doing</u> here...
What do <u>you</u> think?  What I need from you:  I need a base of operations.  Some place in the District.  I need some clean <u>money</u> ...
And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, <u>Why</u>?"  "In the Crisis."
Why not?
"The Country Is At War." 
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania?
...it's a Teaser!
"Back End" ... count on it.
President's speech.
They got him standing by.
...that's right.
Might, if I was asked... 
Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...
You've <u>got</u> something, there...
Get on your feet, boy.
We have no home.  We're vagrants.  N'each man's hand's against us.  We killed Old Shoe...  We killed the Schuster...spend our life in a packingcrate...Where are you <u>going</u>...?
Ha ha.  No, no, not <u>now</u>, not <u>now</u>, of course, But Someday... when they tell <u>this</u> story...
He raped a <u>Nun</u>...
...but...
They'll be here in ten minutes.
Keep Talking....
What guards Us Against Canada...?
Military Special Programs... <u>Programs</u>... No, I am not Shouting at you, I'm... I'm sorry.  Anyone named <u>Shoe</u> Schumann?  <u>Schuster</u>... uh
See y'at the Finish Line.
We had Davy Crockett hats... They made a fortune.
Thank God this is America.
Can we give'er a <u>kitten</u>?
Albania, Albania, Albania, James bond Villains.
John Belushi... <u>Jim</u> Belushi...
A beret.
Hey, <u>you're</u> getting the big bucks....  I think we're up-and-running...
Yes. 
...for the beans, yes...
He's not dead, Ronnie.  He's just a little understandab1y, <u>fatigued</u>.  Let's get him to some help...
Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.
Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you.
...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?
...not that you learned anything, Chunk.
...gotta read my reports.
Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me.
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
About what?
Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
You're learning, sport...
Yeah, I'm gonna make you rich, Bud Fox. I'm gonna make you rich enough you can afford a girl like Darien. Remember, power is the best aphrodisiac. This is your wake-up call. Go to work.
Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside.
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
...I can't make it tonight.
Stock broker. As in: never have so few done so little for so much. So what do you see in this?
You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
How would I know? I once bet a horse. He went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five.
Yeah, almost...
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it. 
Sure... But your fee... considering you're way over budget, should be negotiable.
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
I'm looking...and I sure don't like what I see.
Old values. Buy.
...that "scum" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day...
It's over you, Gordon.
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
He still likes you
Yeah 
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
About what?  About us.
Hmm.
Would you like a closer look?
Thank you Jenkins
And uh, your nicotine sir
She went to a waxwork party
A party at a waxwork huh?
Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
Big deal!
Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
I'll come back all the time.
Why?
What do you mean?
What?
I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
Pretty.  She's a blond.
Your friend saw them.
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
I am.
No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
And these roses.  They're much prettier up close.
You're going to think I'm crazy or something.
Claire.
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
Wow.  Got here just in time.  I brought you this.
What?
Telling you...
This.
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
But Claire--
I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
Did he say that?
Don't.
How is it?
You are...
We did.
Remember how we were?
That's not what I'm sug--
But what if something happens?
Hurry...
Unless you need me to come home...
Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
Really?
Shhhh.
From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.
She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.
Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
Call ya later.
Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
Wouldn't go that far.
Claire--
That's not what I'm sayi--
I never asked you to quit!
And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
How can you be sure?
Huh.
Do you know it?
You don't have to do that.
But you've not told Michael.
With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
What are you talk---
It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.
When did she die...?
And this - if you decide to take the rest.
The lamplight.  That's all.
You have the Mayfair eyes.   Tell me, Rowan --- what have those eyes seen that the mind can't fathom...?
ENOUGH!!!
But I had to use my hands.  None before you could kill with their mind.  Graham, my dear.  Your uncle...?
He's herniating!  Forget OR.  He's dead batore he's oft the elevator Get me a trephine tray -  Anesthesia - stat!  We need him intubated and blow down!
What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
But I could understand. I want to understand!
Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
Yessss...
Always loved you. Rowan.  Always...
I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.  I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  Why don't we go to my office...
'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..
No. I'm not.  Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things.
You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you...
It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
All I meant was -
Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
That's GREAT!
So how come I love you most when you stick your finger in your chin...?
Mm-hmm...
I'm serious.    Whatever it was - it's still there inside me, isn't it - change and all...?
I don't know.
Where are you gitting these...?  Aaron --- if it's a boy.
Nothing is wrong with me.  I know something's in there - and so do you.
I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
It's not true.  You have to believe me.
I can't leave now.  Don't ask me to explain!  I just can't!
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
Just nervous.  Getting married, you know.     Got the rings...?
I like him.  He can stay.
Papers...?
Then it's going to be 'I killed for sex'... Listen darling, why won't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ELLEN CARTER writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units. You haven't written anything in four years darling - I know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping, there's not going to be a magazine for you to write for...
Yes - it's about bank safety deposit boxes - I wonder if you might just explain how they work - and maybe even show me round.
Well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then I could show you everything and  then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points...
Yes it is...
No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
No - not all the time - I mean
No - I've been abroad for a long time...
Sure...
The touch?
Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book
Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them! 
OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes, blonde hair...
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
Yes - I suppose so...
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
No - I'll have you after
What's this all about?
I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
Oh...
Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.
That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You've been over-tenderizing your meat, again.
That's crazy talk.
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
Maybe he got promoted.
For a guy about to try his first Dom Perignon, you are extremely uptight.
Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
Check it out!
Take a whiff of heaven.
Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.
Chicks are like buses. If you miss one, don't sweat it. There's another coming 'round the corner.
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
God, I love being dead.
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
From your lips, to God's ears.
But that smile.
Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
So you'll think about it?
I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible.
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
We miss you. We miss our son.
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
It's okay. You need me?
You mean they knew who I was?
My legacy.
It's really late...do your parents know where you are?
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
You ever look down on them again and call them "grocers" like it's a dirty word, and you'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks. Got it?
That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
I don't get the distinction.
I guess.
Interesting.
I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
I know.
Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.
There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
Let's do it.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
I decided to let Helen run the magazine. I need to go to college, learn a few things, you know.
What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
But how would we pay our bills?
You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
If that were true, this would be one seriously constipated town. Most guys in Xenia have been looking at naked girls in "Heaven" since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it under the mattress.
Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.
A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
Really? You'd do that for me?
In other words, our scope is too narrow.
You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.
We've got a huge problem with the magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk.
Bad news.
I'm just a messenger.
Kelly Van Ryan...
Kelly.
And where might that be?
Raised her like she was, but no, Walter's my only child.  He was a good boy, till the army took him.
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
You mean he withdrew...
Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
Ray thinks she was murdered.
I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did...
Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it?
The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay.
You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
You didn't cuff her?
Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen.  And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp.
Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?
No!
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
You are.
What brain?
About what?  How to improve your breast stroke?
I'm not on your property!
Hi, Mon.
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
I won't.
I love you.  Now give me the line.
Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...
That's right.  That was his name.
Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?
Yes.  Mainly to turn her toward the door.  I told her we would talk on Monday, in the office.
Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already.
I think there's some things you do, you don't want to see yourself doing them.
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
Interesting.  Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk...
No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
Absolutely.  Have to look for clues... even if it means dancing with beautiful women.
Jim, people talk to foreigners, speak more openly, especially to those as famous as I, Chauncey McNeil Armstrong, English lyric poet.
All that jumping and kicking.
I'm going to hit you.
Uh... how long ago was this?
I was six.  And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
There's only seventy-eight.
Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.
I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake?
No, sir... just a businessman.
I deal with some tough customers.
Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
He thought you were a woman, Airk!
Is this what's left of your army?
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others.  You lack faith in your- self.  You must learn to trust your intuition.
Say what?
Madmartigan.
I will!  But I need help!
I don't know.
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
Elora Danan!
Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed me.  She robbed me of my dream.
Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard time.  You were in her ten all night.  Did she say anything?
What are you gonna become, Raziel? Queen of the rodents?
She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini...
Me!
Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur- ry!  Invocation!  Release them!
Just do it!
Shut up.
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
Queen Cherlindrea?
Why not?
I can't see anything--she's too bright!
Try the house.
No matter. Come with me. We can always use a good carpenter.
Yes, sir.
Sure have, Sam.
What have you got?
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Just us.
No.
Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.
I can't.
What about Samuel? Will you come back to take him to trial?
Can I have something to drink?
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
But you can't.
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
You can go with Eli. He's taking Samuel to school. But you'll have to hurry.
Oh. The bullets.
I see.  But I hope you have a lot of sugar.  Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
Johnny, what the fuck?
Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
He's got my number.
I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
Looks dead...
I have committed no sin.
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do it... quick! Like that! And then... then I can not sit at table with you. I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting!  Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child!
Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
You'll be hist...
Do you presume to criticize the....
Who are you?
Hickory!
Oh, please give me back my dog!
Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Why --
Do you know any?  Oh, you mean the thing -- Yes, well, I -- I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's....
Oh -- yes.
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
Uh-huh.
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
...Oh, did that hurt?
No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?
Oh --
Lions and tigers and bears!
No, but you tried to.
Yes.
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If....
Not nobody, not nohow!
Ohh!
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
Lion, darling -- I knew you'd come!
Did I scare you?
Where's Kansas?
Um-hmm.
Do -- do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
It's too late!  There they....
Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
Very well -- I'll bide my time -- and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like, but just try to stay out of my way....
Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
Don't you start it, too!
What was that?
Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
Quiet!
A heart --
Emerald City!
I can fairly hear my heart beating!
Oh - look out.
Go on!
Well, I --
Help!
The soldiers may give you a hard time. Whatever. If we weren’t around, they’d have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun.
It’s part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
But what if...
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  She’s beautiful isn’t she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
It’s I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
A word? I’m sure by now he’s engineered a hostile takeover.
My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. He’s decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette.
I have to go to work.
Not at that price. Time to surrender.
Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
What class sub does your nephew run?
Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.
Is it?
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
I would like to use the bathroom --
They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
Jon -- what??
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
I've seen them!  I've seen them in there. 
We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
You're sure?
I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?
Old?
One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
Laurie --
With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
Don't look.  Turn around.
That's because --
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
Coward.  Giving up.
What caused it?
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
We should get back to the lab.  You okay, Jon?
Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
Did you know he was back on the streets?
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
Please.
You're making a big --
ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
What do I get out of it?
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
Yes it does.
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
You're a jerk-off, you know that?
Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called "Ahab". Whatever it is, it cost him his life.
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
"Anarchy" 99"?
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
Like what?
I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two, max.
So cute. He shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife.
Did you guys used to date? That's it, right? He broke your heart and you're still soft on him. That's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you.
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
I was invited. What's your story?
I'm from L.A.
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said.
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
Go to the water, it's that way!
I'm through, Xander.
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
My old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet. Me, I don't believe in nothing I can't see and touch.
Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.
Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
Sure you are, sport.
You mutant bastards...
I believe he wants you for your Adamantium.
I felt like she almost killed me.
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.
Yes, my dear, he is.
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
Oh, shit.
Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.
Ugly, vicious rumous.
Poppycock!
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
I did, sir.
'Functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.'
Baack!
MMMmmmm.
MMmmm.
Love me oodles and oodles?
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
Whatever makes you happy.
Surprised!
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
No, of course not.  I just meant...
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
Do you have a hundred thousand of them, sir?
Break that old man's violin.
Yes, sir.
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
I beg your pardon?
A piece of what?
Vermicelli.
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
Was he any good?
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
Why?
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
Yes, Master!
Act casual!
What did you find out?
Someone was playing this in the music room.
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
... It's.
Soo -- pah doo -- per.
'Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.'
Yes -- quickly, dear!
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
And I have mine.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
What d'ya want to do to kill time?
Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
Our friend Colonel Dumford will be  should be   at this minute approaching Pulleine. I think we'll eat here. I want to scout that mountain top and be back with an appetite in one hour. .
Our runners bare his dispatches, do they not?
A large party of Zulus have been sighted in the direction of the King's KraaL Getting up, CHELMSFORD moves over to look at the map on his desk.
Well that's typical of Her Majesty's army. Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
